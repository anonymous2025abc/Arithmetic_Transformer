How old is the youngest brother?,29.0,"To find the age of the youngest brother, we need to first find the ages of the three oldest brothers. 

Let's denote the age of the youngest brother as x. Since the three oldest brothers are consecutive integers, their ages can be represented as x+1, x+2, and x+3.

We know that the sum of their ages is 96. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x+1) + (x+2) + (x+3) = 96

Combine like terms:

4x + 6 = 96

Subtract 6 from both sides:

4x = 90

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 22.5

However, since age cannot be a fraction, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The sum of the ages of the three oldest brothers is 96, and their ages are consecutive integers. This means that the sum of their ages can be represented as (x+1) + (x+2) + (x+3) = 96.

We can also represent the sum of their ages as (x+1) + (x+2) + (x+3) = 3x + 6 = 96.

Now, we can solve for x:

3x + 6 = 96

Subtract 6 from both sides:

3x = 90

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 30

However, this is the age of the youngest of the three oldest brothers. We need to find the age of the youngest brother, which is 1 year younger than the youngest of the three oldest brothers.

Given that the total produce of mangoes is 400 kg.

The total produce of apples is twice the total produce of mangoes:
Apples = 2 * Mangoes
Apples = 2 * 400
Apples = 800 kg

The total produce of oranges is 200 kg more than that of mangoes:
Oranges = Mangoes + 200
Oranges = 400 + 200
Oranges = 600 kg

He produced 100 kg fewer bananas than apples:
Bananas = Apples - 100
Bananas = 800 - 100
Bananas = 700 kg

The total produce of peaches is half the total produce of oranges:
Peaches = Oranges / 2
Peaches = 600 / 2

Total produce = Apples + Mangoes + Oranges + Bananas + Peaches
Total produce = 800 + 400 + 600 + 700 + 300

For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs. The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",77.0,"To find the total number of gumballs in the machine, we need to calculate the number of each color of gumball and add them together.

1. The machine has 16 red gumballs.
2. The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs. 
   So, blue gumballs = 16 / 2 = 8
3. For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs.
   So, green gumballs = 8 * 4 = 32
4. The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs.
   So, yellow gumballs = 8
5. The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs.
   So, purple gumballs = 16 - 3 = 13

Now, let's add the number of each color of gumball together:
Total gumballs = red + blue + green + yellow + purple
Total gumballs = 16 + 8 + 32 + 8 + 13
Total gumballs = 77

The final answer is: 77",77,77.0,True,
