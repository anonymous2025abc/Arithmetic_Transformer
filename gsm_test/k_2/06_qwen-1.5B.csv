If Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, how many candies remained?",600.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each type of candy and then calculate the total number of candies remaining after Carlos eats all the yellow ones.

First, let's find out how many yellow candies there are. We know that there are 40 red candies and 20 fewer yellow candies than three times as many red candies. So, if \( y \) is the number of yellow candies, we can write:

\[ y = 3 \times 40 - 20 \]
\[ y = 120 - 20 \]
\[ y = 100 \]

So, there are 100 yellow candies.

Next, we need to find out how many blue candies there are. The problem states that there are half as many blue candies as yellow candies. Since there are 100 yellow candies, the number of blue candies \( b \) is:

\[ b = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 \]
\[ b = 50 \]

So, there are 50 blue candies.

Now, let's find out how many green candies there are. The problem states that there are half as many green candies as red candies. Since there are 40 red candies, the number of green candies \( g \) is:

\[ g = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 \]
\[ g = 20 \]

So, there are 20 green candies.

Finally, let's find out how many purple candies there are. The problem states that there are 10 less than five times as many purple candies as yellow candies. Since there are 100 yellow candies, the number of purple candies \( p \) is:

\[ p = 5 \times 100 - 10 \]
\[ p = 500 - 10 \]
\[ p = 490 \]

So, there are 490 purple candies.

Now, we add up all the candies to get the total number of candies before Carlos eats any:

If Carlos eats all of the yellow candies, he will eat 100 yellow candies. Therefore, the number of candies remaining is:

- House 2: There are 20 carpets.
- House 3: There are 10 carpets.
- House 4: House 4 has twice as many carpets as house 3. Therefore, the number of carpets in house 4 is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) carpets.
- House 5: There are 8 carpets.
- House 6: House 6 has 4 times as many carpets as house 5. Therefore, the number of carpets in house 6 is \(4 \times 8 = 32\) carpets.

Now, we add up the number of carpets from all six houses:

\[
12 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 8 + 32

- **Points Added in Last 40 Seconds:**
  - 2 two-point baskets = \(2 \times 2 = 4\) points
- **Total Points After 40 Seconds:**

How much, in dollars, will the store need to pay to fill the displays?",796.0,"To determine how much the jewelry store needs to pay to fill all the displays, we first calculate the number of each item needed for each display:

- **Necklaces**: The stand can hold 12 necklaces, but it already has 5. Therefore, it needs \(12 - 5 = 7\) more necklaces.
- **Rings**: The display can hold 30 rings, but it already has 18. Therefore, it needs \(30 - 18 = 12\) more rings.
- **Bracelets**: The display can hold 15 bracelets, but it already has 8. Therefore, it needs \(15 - 8 = 7\) more bracelets.
- **Watches**: The display can hold 20 watches, but it already has 7. Therefore, it needs \(20 - 7 = 13\) more watches.
- **Earrings**: The display can hold 50 earrings, but it already has 14. Therefore, it needs \(50 - 14 = 36\) more earrings.

Next, we calculate the cost for each type of item based on their respective prices:

Sara collected five times as many blue marbles as Mary. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?",245.0,"Let's start by defining the variables for each person based on the information given:

- Let \( J_r \) be the number of red marbles Jenny collected.
- Let \( J_b \) be the number of blue marbles Jenny collected.
- Let \( M_r \) be the number of red marbles Mary collected.
- Let \( M_b \) be the number of blue marbles Mary collected.
- Let \( A_r \) be the number of red marbles Anie collected.
- Let \( A_b \) be the number of blue marbles Anie collected.
- Let \( T_r \) be the number of red marbles Tom collected.
- Let \( T_b \) be the number of blue marbles Tom collected.
- Let \( S_r \) be the number of red marbles Sara collected.
- Let \( S_b \) be the number of blue marbles Sara collected.

We know from the problem that:
\[ J_r = 30 \]
\[ J_b = 25 \]

First, we calculate the number of red marbles collected by Mary:
\[ M_r = 2J_r = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

Next, we calculate the number of red marbles collected by Anie:
\[ A_r = J_r + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \]

Then, we calculate the number of blue marbles collected by Anie:
\[ A_b = 2J_b = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Now, we calculate the number of red marbles collected by Tom:
\[ T_r = 3M_r = 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

And the number of blue marbles collected by Tom:
\[ T_b = A_b - 5 = 50 - 5 = 45 \]

Next, we calculate the number of red marbles collected by Sara:
\[ S_r = A_r - 10 = 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Finally, we calculate the number of blue marbles collected by Sara:
\[ S_b = 5M_b = 5 \times (J_b / 2) = 5 \times (25 / 2) = 5 \times 12.5 = 62.5 \]

Since the number of marbles must be an integer, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or error in the problem statement. However, assuming the problem is correctly stated and we proceed with the calculations as if they were integers, the total number of blue marbles collected by all friends would be:
\[ J_b + A_b + M_b + T_b + S_b = 25 + 50 + M_b + 45 + 62.5 \]

But since \( M_b \) is not provided directly, let's assume it should be calculated similarly to the other numbers. For simplicity, let's assume \( M_b = 25 \) (as a reasonable guess):
\[ J_b + A_b + M_b + T_b + S_b = 25 + 50 + 25 + 45 + 62.5 = 207.5 \]

However, typically such problems expect whole numbers, so let's re-evaluate the assumptions. Given the problem constraints and typical expectations, we can conclude that the correct approach involves solving for \( M_b \) using consistent integer values, but without additional context, this is the most straightforward interpretation under the given conditions.

Thus, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together, assuming integer values for \( M_b \), would be:

Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda and half as many pieces of bread as treats. If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",315.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pieces of bread and treats each person brought to the zoo based on the information given.

First, let's define variables for the number of treats and pieces of bread each person brings:

- Let \( J \) be the number of treats Jane brings.
- Let \( B_J \) be the number of pieces of bread Jane brings.
- Let \( W \) be the number of treats Wanda brings.
- Let \( B_W \) be the number of pieces of bread Wanda brings.
- Let \( C \) be the number of treats Carlos brings.
- Let \( B_C \) be the number of pieces of bread Carlos brings.
- Let \( M \) be the number of treats Mia brings.
- Let \( B_M \) be the number of pieces of bread Mia brings.

From the problem statement, we know the following relationships:

1. Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats: 
   \[
   B_J = 0.75J
   \]

2. Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane:
   \[
   W = \frac{1}{2}J
   \]
   Since Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, we can find \( J \):
   \[
   B_W = 3W = 3 \times 90 = 270
   \]
   Using the relationship between treats and pieces of bread for Wanda:
   \[
   B_W = 0.75W
   \]
   Substituting \( W = \frac{1}{2}J \):
   \[
   270 = 0.75 \left( \frac{1}{2}J \right)
   \]
   Solving for \( J \):
   \[
   270 = 0.375J \implies J = \frac{270}{0.375} = 720
   \]

3. Carlos brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats:
   \[
   B_C = 3C
   \]

4. Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda:
   \[
   M = W - 10 = \frac{1}{2}J - 10 = \frac{1}{2}(720) - 10 = 360 - 10 = 350
   \]
   Mia also brings half as many pieces of bread as treats:
   \[
   B_M = \frac{1}{2}M = \frac{1}{2}(350) = 175
   \]

Now, we sum up all the treats and pieces of bread brought by each person:

- Total treats:
  \[
  T_{\text{total}} = J + W + C + M = 720 + \frac{1}{2}J + 3C + (350 - 10) = 720 + 360 + 3C + 340 = 1420 + 3C
  \]

- Total pieces of bread:
  \[
  B_{\text{total}} = B_J + B_W + B_C + B_M = 0.75J + 270 + 3C + 175 = 0.75(720) + 270 + 3C + 175 = 540 + 270 + 3C + 175 = 985 + 3C

Since there are no additional constraints provided about the number of treats or pieces of bread Carlos brings, we assume he brings the minimum possible value which is zero for simplicity unless specified otherwise. Therefore, the calculations remain valid with \( C = 0 \).

Let's start with Lisa:
- Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers.

Next, let's find out how many rehabilitation centers Jude visited:
- Jude visited half as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa.
\[ \text{Jude's visits} = \frac{\text{Lisa's visits}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Now, let's find out how many rehabilitation centers Han visited:
- Han visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude.
\[ \text{Han's visits} = 2 \times \text{Jude's visits} - 2 = 2 \times 3 - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4 \]

Next, let's find out how many rehabilitation centers Omar visited:
- Omar visited 3 more rehabilitation centers than Jude.
\[ \text{Omar's visits} = \text{Jude's visits} + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 \]

Now, let's find out how many rehabilitation centers Priya visited:
- Priya visited 1 less than three times as many rehabilitation centers as Han.
\[ \text{Priya's visits} = 3 \times \text{Han's visits} - 1 = 3 \times 4 - 1 = 12 - 1 = 11 \]

Finally, let's find out how many rehabilitation centers Jane visited:
- Jane visited 6 more than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Han.
\[ \text{Jane's visits} = 2 \times \text{Han's visits} + 6 = 2 \times 4 + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14 \]

If Marcus walks at 6 miles per hour, how much time does he spend with his dog total?",72.0,"To determine the total time Marcus spends with his dog, we need to break down each activity and sum up the times.

1. **Bath Time:**
   Marcus spends 20 minutes giving his dog a bath.

2. **Blow-Drying Time:**
   Marcus spends half as long blow-drying his dog as he did bathing her. Therefore, the blow-drying time is:
   \[
   \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Brushing Time:**
   Marcus spends 8 minutes brushing his dog.

4. **Trimming Nails Time:**
   Marcus spends half as long trimming her nails as he spent brushing her. Therefore, the trimming nails time is:
   \[
   \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Walking Time:**
   Marcus walks his dog along a 3-mile trail at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The walking time can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}

   Converting this time into minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 30 \text{ minutes}

Now, let's add up all these times:

\[
20 \text{ minutes (bathing)} + 10 \text{ minutes (blow-drying)} + 8 \text{ minutes (brushing)} + 4 \text{ minutes (trimming nails)} + 30 \text{ minutes (walking)}

1. **Length of the pencil:**
   The pencil is given as 12 centimeters long.

2. **Length of the pen:**
   The pen is longer than the rubber by 3 centimeters. Let's denote the length of the rubber as \( R \) cm. Therefore, the length of the pen is \( R + 3 \) cm.

3. **Length of the pen (revisited):**
   The pen is also shorter than the pencil by 2 centimeters. Since the pencil is 12 cm long, the pen must be \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) cm long. So, we have:
   \[
   R + 3 = 10

   Solving for \( R \):
   \[
   R = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ cm}

How old is the youngest brother?,29.0,"Let's denote the age of the youngest brother as \( x \). Since the ages of the three oldest brothers are consecutive integers and their total age is 96, we can express the ages of the three oldest brothers as follows:

- The first oldest brother: \( x + 2 \)
- The second oldest brother: \( x + 3 \)
- The third oldest brother: \( x + 4 \)

According to the problem, the sum of these three ages is 96. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
(x + 2) + (x + 3) + (x + 4) = 96
\]

Next, we simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
x + 2 + x + 3 + x + 4 = 96
\]
\[
3x + 9 = 96
\]

To isolate \( x \), we subtract 9 from both sides of the equation:

\[
3x = 87
\]

Then, we divide both sides by 3:

\[
x = 29
\]

So, the age of the youngest brother is \( 29 \).

Now, let's verify this solution by calculating the ages of the other two brothers:

- The first oldest brother: \( x + 2 = 29 + 2 = 31 \)
- The second oldest brother: \( x + 3 = 29 + 3 = 32 \)
- The third oldest brother: \( x + 4 = 29 + 4 = 33 \)

Adding these ages together confirms that they sum up to 96:

\[
31 + 32 + 33 = 96

Thus, the age of the youngest brother is indeed \( 29 \).

- Let \( E \) be the time it takes Emma to run all around the two arenas.
- Since it takes Fernando twice as long as Emma, Fernando's time is \( 2E \).
- Gina takes half as long as Fernando, so Gina's time is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2E = E \).
- Harold takes 10 hours more than Emma, so Harold's time is \( E + 10 \).

### Initial Winnings
Opal initially won $100.00.

### First Bet
She puts half of her winnings into savings and bets the other half.
- Amount put into savings: \( \frac{100}{2} = \$50.00 \)
- Amount bet: \( \frac{100}{2} = \$50.00 \)

This time, she makes a 60% profit.
- Profit: \( 0.60 \times 50 = \$30.00 \)
- Total after profit: \( 50 + 30 = \$80.00 \)

She puts half of this amount into savings.
- Amount put into savings: \( \frac{80}{2} = \$40.00 \)

### Second Bet
She now has $40 left (since she didn't save any more).
- Amount bet: \( \frac{40}{2} = \$20.00 \)

This time, she makes a 25% profit.
- Profit: \( 0.25 \times 20 = \$5.00 \)
- Total after profit: \( 20 + 5 = \$25.00 \)

She puts half of this amount into savings.
- Amount put into savings: \( \frac{25}{2} = \$12.50 \)

So, after the second round, she has saved up to $102.50 ($90 from the previous rounds plus $12.50 from the second bet).

### Third Bet
She now has $20 left (since she didn't save any more).
- Amount bet: \( \frac{20}{2} = \$10.00 \)

This time, she makes a 20% profit.

2. **Monthly Costs**:
   - Monthly cost per person: $1000
   - Number of people: 4
   \[
   \text{Total monthly costs} = 4 \times 1000 = 4000

Safari National park also has twice as many zebras as giraffes. Savanna National park has half as many zebras as lions. Safari National park also has 5 fewer elephants than snakes. Savanna National park has 20 more elephants than Safari National park. How many animals in total does Savanna National park have?",575.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each type of animal in both Safari National Park (SNP) and Savanna National Park (SNP), then sum them up.

### Step 1: Determine the number of animals in SNP

- **Lions**: SNP has 100 lions.
- **Snakes**: SNP has half as many snakes as lions, so \( \frac{100}{2} = 50 \) snakes.
- **Giraffes**: SNP has 10 fewer giraffes than snakes, so \( 50 - 10 = 40 \) giraffes.
- **Zebras**: SNP has twice as many zebras as giraffes, so \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \) zebras.
- **Elephants**: SNP has 5 fewer elephants than snakes, so \( 50 - 5 = 45 \) elephants.

So, the total number of animals in SNP is:
\[ 100 + 50 + 40 + 80 + 45 = 315 \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of animals in SNP

- **Lions**: SNP has double as many lions as SNP, so \( 2 \times 100 = 200 \) lions.
- **Snakes**: SNP has triple as many snakes as SNP, so \( 3 \times 50 = 150 \) snakes.
- **Giraffes**: SNP has 20 more giraffes than SNP, so \( 40 + 20 = 60 \) giraffes.
- **Zebras**: SNP has half as many zebras as lions, so \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) zebras.
- **Elephants**: SNP has 20 more elephants than SNP, so \( 45 + 20 = 65 \) elephants.

So, the total number of animals in SNP is:
\[ 200 + 150 + 60 + 100 + 65 = 575 \]

How much did he spend?,8200.0,"To determine how much Tim spent on his animals, we need to calculate the cost of each type of animal and then sum these costs.

1. **Cost of Goats:**
   - Tim bought 3 goats at $400 each.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of goats} = 3 \times 400 = 1200
   \]

2. **Cost of Llamas:**
   - Tim bought twice as many llamas as goats, so he bought \(2 \times 3 = 6\) llamas.
   - Each llama costs 50% more than a goat, so each llama costs:
     \[
     400 + (0.5 \times 400) = 400 + 200 = 600
     \]
   - The total cost for the llamas is:
     \[
     6 \times 600 = 3600

3. **Cost of Alpacas:**
   - Each alpaca costs 25% less than a llama, so each alpaca costs:
     \[
     600 - (0.25 \times 600) = 600 - 150 = 450
     \]
   - Tim bought 4 alpacas, so the total cost for the alpacas is:
     \[
     4 \times 450 = 1800

If she travels in her sailboat under optimal wind conditions for 4 hours with one sail and then for another 4 hours with two sails, Under the same conditions, the use of three sails brings the ship to the speed of 60 knots, and she sails for 1 hour using three sails. Under the same conditions, the use of four sails brings the ship to the speed of 70 knots, and she sails for 2 hours using four sails. what is the total distance, in land miles, that she will travel?",575.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance traveled at each speed and then sum them up.

First, let's find out how far Buffy travels with one sail:

- Speed with one sail = 25 knots
- Time with one sail = 4 hours

Distance with one sail = Speed × Time
= 25 knots × 4 hours
= 100 nautical miles

Next, let's find out how far Buffy travels with two sails:

- Speed with two sails = 50 knots
- Time with two sails = 4 hours

Distance with two sails = Speed × Time
= 50 knots × 4 hours
= 200 nautical miles

Now, let's find out how far Buffy travels with three sails:

- Speed with three sails = 60 knots
- Time with three sails = 1 hour

Distance with three sails = Speed × Time
= 60 knots × 1 hour
= 60 nautical miles

Finally, let's find out how far Buffy travels with four sails:

- Speed with four sails = 70 knots
- Time with four sails = 2 hours

Distance with four sails = Speed × Time
= 70 knots × 2 hours

Now, we add all these distances together to get the total distance traveled:

Total distance = Distance with one sail + Distance with two sails + Distance with three sails + Distance with four sails
= 100 nautical miles + 200 nautical miles + 60 nautical miles + 140 nautical miles
= 500 nautical miles

Since 1 nautical mile equals 1.15 land miles, we can convert the total distance from nautical miles to land miles:

First, let's determine the price of men's t-shirts:

- White men's t-shirts: $20
- Black men's t-shirts: $18

Since women's t-shirts are $5 cheaper than men's t-shirts of the same color, we can find the price of women's t-shirts as follows:

What is the total number of legs in his entire collection?,190.0,"To determine the total number of legs in Monroe's entire collection, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of insect separately and then sum them up.

First, let's consider the spiders:
- Each spider has 8 legs.
- Monroe has 8 spiders.
So, the total number of legs from the spiders is:
\[ 8 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs/spider} = 64 \text{ legs} \]

Next, let's consider the ants:
- Each ant has 6 legs.
- Monroe has 12 ants.
So, the total number of legs from the ants is:
\[ 12 \text{ ants} \times 6 \text{ legs/ant} = 72 \text{ legs} \]

Now, let's consider the beetles:
- We don't know how many legs each beetle has, but since the problem doesn't specify, we'll assume they have no legs (as it's not mentioned otherwise).
- Monroe has 5 beetles.
So, the total number of legs from the beetles is:
\[ 5 \text{ beetles} \times 0 \text{ legs/beetle} = 0 \text{ legs} \]

Finally, let's consider the scorpions:
- Each scorpion has 8 legs.
- Monroe has 3 scorpions.
So, the total number of legs from the scorpions is:
\[ 3 \text{ scorpions} \times 8 \text{ legs/scorpion} = 24 \text{ legs} \]

Now, we sum up all the legs:
\[ 64 \text{ legs (spiders)} + 72 \text{ legs (ants)} + 0 \text{ legs (beetles)} + 24 \text{ legs (scorpions)} = 160 \text{ legs} \]

Therefore, the total number of legs in Monroe's entire collection is:

\boxed{160}

6,qwen-1.5B,Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct,2,50,49,"A gumball machine has red, green, and blue gumballs. The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs. For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs. The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",77.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each type of gumball based on the given relationships between them.

Let's denote the number of red gumballs as \( R \), green gumballs as \( G \), blue gumballs as \( B \), yellow gumballs as \( Y \), and purple gumballs as \( P \).

From the problem statement, we have the following information:

1. There are half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs: 
   \[
   B = \frac{R}{2}
   \]

2. For each blue gumball, there are 4 times as many green gumballs:
   \[
   G = 4B
   \]

3. The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs:
   \[
   Y = B
   \]

4. The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs:
   \[
   P = R - 3
   \]

We know that the machine has 16 red gumballs:
\[
R = 16
\]

Now let's substitute \( R = 16 \) into the equations for \( B \), \( G \), \( Y \), and \( P \):

1. Calculate \( B \):
   \[
   B = \frac{R}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
   \]

2. Calculate \( G \):
   \[
   G = 4B = 4 \times 8 = 32
   \]

3. Calculate \( Y \):
   \[
   Y = B = 8
   \]

4. Calculate \( P \):
   \[
   P = R - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13
   \]

Finally, sum up all the gumballs to find the total number of gumballs in the machine:
\[
R + B + G + Y + P = 16 + 8 + 32 + 8 + 13 = 79
\]

Therefore, the total number of gumballs in the machine is:
\[
\boxed{79}
