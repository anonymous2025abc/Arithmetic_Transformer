1. **Bob's Sheep:**
   - Bob has 20 sheep.

2. **Alice's Sheep:**
   - Alice has 5 times as many sheep as Bob.
   - Therefore, Alice has \( 5 \times 20 = 100 \) sheep.

3. **Seattle's Sheep:**
   - Seattle has 2 times as many sheep as Alice.
   - Therefore, Seattle has \( 2 \times 100 = 200 \) sheep.

4. **Charleston's Sheep:**
   - Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   - Therefore, Charleston has \( 4 \times 200 = 800 \) sheep.

5. **Toulouse's Sheep:**
   - Toulouse has 2 times as many sheep as Charleston.
   - Therefore, Toulouse has \( 2 \times 800 = 1600 \) sheep.

- Let \( T_M \) be the number of treats Mia brings.
- Let \( B_M \) be the number of pieces of bread Mia brings.

From the problem, we know:
1. Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats: \( B_J = 0.75T_J \).
2. Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane: \( T_W = \frac{1}{2}T_J \).
3. Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats: \( B_W = 3T_W \).

A crayon is 2 centimeters shorter than the rubber. what is the total length of the rubber, the pen, the pencil, and all the other stationery items mentioned altogether?",47.0,"Let's define the lengths of each item step by step.

1. **Pencil Length:**
   - Given: The pencil is 12 centimeters long.
   \[
   \text{Length of Pencil} = 12 \text{ cm}
   \]

2. **Pen Length:**
   - The pen is shorter than the pencil by 2 centimeters.
   \[
   \text{Length of Pen} = 12 \text{ cm} - 2 \text{ cm} = 10 \text{ cm}
   \]

3. **Marker Length:**
   - The marker is 1 centimeter longer than the pencil.
   \[
   \text{Length of Marker} = 12 \text{ cm} + 1 \text{ cm} = 13 \text{ cm}
   \]

4. **Crayon Length:**
   - The crayon is 2 centimeters shorter than the rubber.
   - We need to find the length of the rubber first.

5. **Rubber Length:**
   - The pen is longer than the rubber by 3 centimeters.
   \[
   \text{Length of Pen} = \text{Length of Rubber} + 3 \text{ cm}
   \]
   - From step 2, we know the pen is 10 centimeters long.
   \[
   10 \text{ cm} = \text{Length of Rubber} + 3 \text{ cm}
   \]
   - Solving for the length of the rubber:
   \[
   \text{Length of Rubber} = 10 \text{ cm} - 3 \text{ cm} = 7 \text{ cm}
   \]

6. **Crayon Length (Revisited):**
   - Now that we know the rubber is 7 centimeters long, the crayon is 2 centimeters shorter than the rubber.
   \[
   \text{Length of Crayon} = 7 \text{ cm} - 2 \text{ cm} = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]

7. **Total Length Calculation:**
   - Summing up the lengths of all the items:
   \[
   \text{Total Length} = \text{Length of Rubber} + \text{Length of Pen} + \text{Length of Pencil} + \text{Length of Marker} + \text{Length of Crayon}

They also have a younger brother named Liam who is 1 year younger than the youngest of the three oldest brothers. They also have a younger brother named Noah who is 1 year younger than Liam. How old is the youngest brother?,29.0,"Let's denote the ages of the three oldest brothers as \(x\), \(x+1\), and \(x+2\), where \(x\) is the age of the youngest of the three oldest brothers. Since their ages are consecutive integers, we can write the equation for their total age as:

\[x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 96\]

First, combine like terms:

\[3x + 3 = 96\]

Next, subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \(x\):

\[3x = 93\]

Then, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \(x\):

\[x = 31\]

So, the youngest of the three oldest brothers is 31 years old.

To verify, let's check the ages of the three oldest brothers: 31, 32, and 33. Their sum is:

\[31 + 32 + 33 = 96\]

This confirms our solution is correct. The younger brother Liam is 1 year younger than the youngest of the three oldest brothers, so Liam is:

\[31 - 1 = 30\]

Noah is 1 year younger than Liam, so Noah is:

\[30 - 1 = 29\]

If his farm produced 400 kg of mangoes and he sold the fruits at $50 per kg, calculate the total amount of money he got in that season.",140000.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( M \) be the total produce of mangoes.
   - Let \( A \) be the total produce of apples.
   - Let \( O \) be the total produce of oranges.
   - Let \( B \) be the total produce of bananas.
   - Let \( P \) be the total produce of peaches.

2. **Given Information:**
   - Mr. Sergio's farm produced 400 kg of mangoes, so \( M = 400 \).
   - The total produce of apples was twice the total produce of mangoes, so \( A = 2M \).
   - The total produce of oranges was 200 kg more than that of mangoes, so \( O = M + 200 \).
   - He produced 100 kg fewer bananas than apples, so \( B = A - 100 \).
   - The total produce of peaches was half the total produce of oranges, so \( P = \frac{O}{2} \).

Under optimal wind conditions, the use of two sails brings the ship to the speed of 50 knots, whereas under the same conditions, the use of one sail brings her ship to the speed of 25 knots. A knot is a nautical term for speed equal to 1 nautical mile per hour, and one nautical mile equals 1.15 land miles. If she travels in her sailboat under optimal wind conditions for 4 hours with one sail and then for another 4 hours with two sails, Under the same conditions, the use of three sails brings the ship to the speed of 60 knots, and she sails for 1 hour using three sails. Under the same conditions, the use of four sails brings the ship to the speed of 70 knots, and she sails for 2 hours using four sails. what is the total distance, in land miles, that she will travel?",575.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance traveled under each set of conditions and then convert those distances from nautical miles to land miles.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled with one sail
- Speed with one sail: 25 knots
- Time: 4 hours

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 25 \, \text{knots} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 100 \, \text{nautical miles} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled with two sails
- Speed with two sails: 50 knots
- Time: 4 hours

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{knots} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{nautical miles} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled with three sails
- Speed with three sails: 60 knots
- Time: 1 hour

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{knots} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 60 \, \text{nautical miles} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled with four sails
- Speed with four sails: 70 knots
- Time: 2 hours

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 70 \, \text{knots} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{nautical miles} \]

### Step 5: Sum up all the distances in nautical miles
\[ \text{Total Distance (nautical miles)} = 100 + 200 + 60 + 140 = 500 \, \text{nautical miles} \]

### Step 6: Convert the total distance from nautical miles to land miles
- 1 nautical mile = 1.15 land miles

\[ \text{Total Distance (land miles)} = 500 \, \text{nautical miles} \times 1.15 \, \text{land miles/nautical mile} = 575 \, \text{land miles} \]

One more friend, Nina, ordered the same as Mell, but she also bought 2 bowls of ice cream. Two more friends each ordered 1 cup of coffee and 2 bowls of ice cream. How much money did Mell and her friends need to pay at the cafeteria?",92.0,"Let's break down the costs step by step.

First, calculate the cost for Mell:
- Mell ordered 2 cups of coffee and 1 piece of cake.
- Cost of 2 cups of coffee: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.
- Cost of 1 piece of cake: \(7\) dollars.
- Total cost for Mell: \(8 + 7 = 15\) dollars.

Next, calculate the cost for each of the first two friends (let's call them Friend A and Friend B):
- Each friend ordered the same as Mell plus 1 bowl of ice cream.
- Cost of 2 cups of coffee and 1 piece of cake: \(15\) dollars (same as Mell).
- Cost of 1 bowl of ice cream: \(3\) dollars.
- Total cost for each friend: \(15 + 3 = 18\) dollars.
- Since there are two such friends, total cost for both: \(2 \times 18 = 36\) dollars.

Now, calculate the cost for Nina:
- Nina ordered the same as Mell plus 2 bowls of ice cream.
- Cost of 2 cups of coffee and 1 piece of cake: \(15\) dollars (same as Mell).
- Cost of 2 bowls of ice cream: \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.
- Total cost for Nina: \(15 + 6 = 21\) dollars.

Finally, calculate the cost for the last two friends (let's call them Friend C and Friend D):
- Each friend ordered 1 cup of coffee and 2 bowls of ice cream.
- Cost of 1 cup of coffee: \(4\) dollars.
- Cost of 2 bowls of ice cream: \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.
- Total cost for each friend: \(4 + 6 = 10\) dollars.
- Since there are two such friends, total cost for both: \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

Now, sum up all the costs:
- Cost for Mell: \(15\) dollars.
- Cost for Friend A and Friend B: \(36\) dollars.
- Cost for Nina: \(21\) dollars.
- Cost for Friend C and Friend D: \(20\) dollars.

He needs to know how many pieces to cut the lasagna into to serve it. Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Another friend, Nora, is picky and will only eat one-third of what Manny eats, and Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. Another friend, Ben, will eat the same amount of lasagna as Kai. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",9.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many pieces of lasagna each person will eat.

1. **Manny**: 
   - Manny wants 1 piece.
   - \( M = 1 \)

2. **Aaron**:
   - Aaron won't eat any lasagna.
   - \( A = 0 \)

3. **Kai**:
   - Kai will eat twice as much as Manny.
   - \( K = 2 \times M = 2 \times 1 = 2 \)

4. **Raphael**:
   - Raphael will eat half the amount Manny does.
   - \( R = \frac{1}{2} \times M = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 = 0.5 \)

5. **Lisa**:
   - Lisa will eat 2 pieces plus any leftover from Raphael.
   - Since Raphael eats 0.5 pieces, he will leave \( 0.5 - 0.5 = 0 \) pieces.
   - Therefore, Lisa will eat 2 pieces.
   - \( L = 2 + 0 = 2 \)

6. **Nora**:
   - Nora will eat one-third of what Manny eats.
   - \( N = \frac{1}{3} \times M = \frac{1}{3} \times 1 = \frac{1}{3} \)
   - After Nora eats, she will leave \( 1 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \) pieces.
   - Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves, which is \( \frac{2}{3} \) pieces.
   - \( L' = \frac{2}{3} \)

7. **Ben**:
   - Ben will eat the same amount as Kai.
   - \( B = K = 2 \)

Now, let's sum up all the pieces of lasagna that will be eaten:

\[
M + A + K + R + L + N + L' + B = 1 + 0 + 2 + 0.5 + 2 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3} + 2
\]

Combine the fractions and whole numbers:

\[
1 + 0 + 2 + 0.5 + 2 + \left( \frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3} \right) + 2 = 1 + 0 + 2 + 0.5 + 2 + 1 + 2
\]

\[
= 1 + 0 + 2 + 0.5 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 9.5
\]

Since we need to cut the lasagna into whole pieces, we round up to the nearest whole number because even a fraction of a piece means an additional slice is needed.
