Alice has 5 times as many sheep as Bob. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle, Alice and Bob have together if Bob has 20 sheep?",2720.0," Let's start by finding out how many sheep each person has based on the information given:

1. Bob has 20 sheep.
2. Alice has 5 times as many sheep as Bob, so Alice has 5 * 20 = 100 sheep.
3. Seattle has 2 times as many sheep as Alice, so Seattle has 2 * 100 = 200 sheep.

His next 4 customers buy 3 DVDs each. His next 2 customers buy 8 DVDs each. His last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs. How many DVDs did Billy sell on Tuesday?,35.0," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold by Billy to each group of customers.

1. The first 3 customers buy 1 DVD each, so that's 3 DVDs.

2. The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so that's 2 * 2 = 4 DVDs.

3. The next 4 customers buy 3 DVDs each, so that's 4 * 3 = 12 DVDs.

4. The next 2 customers buy 8 DVDs each, so that's 2 * 8 = 16 DVDs.

5. The last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs, so that's 0 DVDs.

Now, we add up all the DVDs sold:

3 (from the first group) + 4 (from the second group) + 12 (from the third group) + 16 (from the fourth group) + 0 (from the last group) = 35 DVDs

On Thursday it rained 1 inches. He can sell water for $1.2 per gallon. How much money did he make from selling all the water?,180.0," First, we need to calculate the total amount of water collected from each day of rain.

On Monday, he collected 4 inches of rain, which is equivalent to 4 * 15.0 = 60.0 gallons.
On Tuesday, he collected 3 inches of rain, which is equivalent to 3 * 15.0 = 45.0 gallons.

Ed found 7 limpet shells, 2 oyster shells, and 4 conch shells, which totals to 7 + 2 + 4 = 13 shells.

Jacob found 2 more shells than Ed, so he found 13 + 2 = 15 shells.

Maya found 12 fewer than Jacob, so she found 15 - 12 = 3 shells.

Liam found 2 more than Maya, so he found 3 + 2 = 5 shells.

Now, let's add the shells they found at the beach to the 2 shells they already had in their collection:

Ed's total shells = 13 (found at the beach) + 2 (already had) = 15 shells.

6. Tom collected 5 fewer blue marbles than Jenny, so Tom collected 25 - 5 = 20 blue marbles.

7. Sara collected 10 fewer red marbles than Anie, so Sara collected 80 - 10 = 70 red marbles.

8. Sara collected five times as many blue marbles as Mary. Since Mary collected 60 red marbles, and the ratio of red to blue marbles for Mary is the same as for Sara, we can find the number of blue marbles Mary collected by dividing the number of red marbles by 2 (since Mary collected half the number of blue marbles as Anie, who collected 50 blue marbles). So, Mary collected 60 / 2 = 30 blue marbles. Therefore, Sara collected 5 * 30 = 150 blue marbles.

Now, let's add up all the blue marbles collected by the friends:

- Jenny collected 25 blue marbles.
- Mary collected 30 blue marbles.
- Anie collected 50 blue marbles.
- Tom collected 20 blue marbles.
- Sara collected 150 blue marbles.

Total blue marbles = 25 (Jenny) + 30 (Mary) + 50 (Anie) + 20 (Tom) + 150 (Sara) = 275 blue marbles.

For Mancino's gardens:
Each garden is 16 feet by 5 feet, so the area of one garden is:
\[ 16 \text{ feet} \times 5 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are 3 gardens, the total area for Mancino's gardens is:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet/garden} \times 3 \text{ gardens} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

For Marquita's gardens:
Each garden is 8 feet by 4 feet, so the area of one garden is:

Since there are 2 gardens, the total area for Marquita's gardens is:
\[ 32 \text{ square feet/garden} \times 2 \text{ gardens} = 64 \text{ square feet} \]

For Luis's gardens:
Each garden is 10 feet by 6 feet, so the area of one garden is:

How many 10 oz servings of punch does Carrie have?",21.0," First, let's calculate the total volume of the punch Carrie made.

She added:
- 6 cans of Mountain Dew, each 12 oz, so 6 * 12 = 72 oz
- 28 oz of ice
- 1 bottle of fruit juice, 40 oz
- 5 cans of ginger ale, each 8 oz, so 5 * 8 = 40 oz
- 2 bottles of orange soda, each 15 oz, so 2 * 15 = 30 oz

Now, let's add all these volumes together to get the total volume of the punch:
72 oz (Mountain Dew) + 28 oz (ice) + 40 oz (fruit juice) + 40 oz (ginger ale) + 30 oz (orange soda) = 210 oz

Now, we need to find out how many 10 oz servings are in 210 oz of punch. To do this, we divide the total volume of the punch by the volume of one serving:
210 oz / 10 oz per serving = 21 servings

Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda and half as many pieces of bread as treats. If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",315.0," Let's start by calculating the number of treats and pieces of bread each person brings based on the information provided.

Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread. Since Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, we can calculate the number of treats Wanda brings:
Wanda's treats = 90 pieces of bread / 3 = 30 treats

Jane brings half as many treats as Wanda, so:
Jane's treats = 30 treats / 2 = 15 treats

Since Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats, we can calculate the number of pieces of bread Jane brings:
Jane's bread = 15 treats * 0.75 = 11.25 pieces of bread

Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane, so:
Carlos's treats = 15 treats / 3 = 5 treats

Carlos brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats, so:
Carlos's bread = 5 treats * 2 = 10 pieces of bread

Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda, so:
Mia's treats = 30 treats - 10 = 20 treats

Mia brings half as many pieces of bread as treats, so:
Mia's bread = 20 treats / 2 = 10 pieces of bread

Now, let's add up all the pieces of bread and treats brought by everyone:

Total bread = Jane's bread + Wanda's bread + Carlos's bread + Mia's bread
Total bread = 11.25 + 90 + 10 + 10 = 121.25 pieces of bread

Total treats = Jane's treats + Wanda's treats + Carlos's treats + Mia's treats
Total treats = 15 + 30 + 5 + 20 = 70 treats

The total number of pieces of bread and treats brought to the zoo is:
Total = Total bread + Total treats
Total = 121.25 + 70 = 191.25

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a piece of bread or a treat, we need to round to the nearest whole number. Since 121.25 is closer to 121 than to 122, we will round down the total number of pieces of bread to 121.

Priya visited 1 less than three times as many rehabilitation centers as Han did. If Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers, how many rehabilitation centers did they all visit in total, assuming they are all different?",44.0," Let's solve this step by step:

1. Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers.
2. Jude visited half as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa did, so Jude visited 6 / 2 = 3 rehabilitation centers.
3. Han visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude did, so Han visited (2 * 3) - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4 rehabilitation centers.
4. Jane visited 6 more than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Han did, so Jane visited (2 * 4) + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14 rehabilitation centers.
5. Omar visited 3 more rehabilitation centers than Jude did, so Omar visited 3 + 3 = 6 rehabilitation centers.
6. Priya visited 1 less than three times as many rehabilitation centers as Han did, so Priya visited (3 * 4) - 1 = 12 - 1 = 11 rehabilitation centers.

If Marcus walks at 6 miles per hour, how much time does he spend with his dog total?",72.0," First, let's calculate the time Marcus spends blow-drying his dog. Since it's half as long as the bath, which is 20 minutes, the blow-drying time is:

20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes

Next, we calculate the time spent trimming the dog's nails, which is half as long as brushing, which is 8 minutes. So the trimming time is:

8 minutes / 2 = 4 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time spent walking the dog. The trail is 3 miles long, and Marcus walks at a speed of 6 miles per hour. To find the time, we use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 3 miles / 6 miles per hour = 0.5 hours

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

0.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes

Finally, we add up all the time spent:

Bath: 20 minutes
Blow-drying: 10 minutes
Brushing: 8 minutes
Trimming nails: 4 minutes
Walking: 30 minutes

Total time = 20 + 10 + 8 + 4 + 30 = 72 minutes

So, Marcus spends a total of 72 minutes with his dog.

How many tarantulas does he need to see to meet his goal?",123.0," First, let's calculate the total number of legs Borgnine has seen so far.

Chimps have 4 legs each, so 12 chimps have 12 * 4 = 48 legs.
Lions have 4 legs each, so 8 lions have 8 * 4 = 32 legs.
Lizards have 4 legs each, so 5 lizards have 5 * 4 = 20 legs.
Penguins have 2 legs each, so 8 penguins have 8 * 2 = 16 legs.
Elephants have 4 legs each, so 6 elephants have 6 * 4 = 24 legs.

Now, let's add up all the legs Borgnine has seen:

48 (chimp legs) + 32 (lion legs) + 20 (lizard legs) + 16 (penguin legs) + 24 (elephant legs) = 140 legs.

Borgnine wants to see a total of 1100 legs. So, the number of legs he still needs to see is:

1100 (total desired legs) - 140 (legs already seen) = 960 legs.

Tarantulas have 8 legs each. To find out how many tarantulas Borgnine needs to see, we divide the remaining number of legs by the number of legs per tarantula:

960 (remaining legs) / 8 (legs per tarantula) = 120 tarantulas.

From the information given:
1. The pen is longer than the rubber by 3 centimeters: P = R + 3
2. The pen is shorter than the pencil by 2 centimeters: P = L - 2
3. The pencil is 12 centimeters long: L = 12

Now, let's find the length of the rubber (R) using the information that the pen is longer than the rubber by 3 centimeters:
P = R + 3

Since we know the pencil is 12 centimeters long and the pen is shorter than the pencil by 2 centimeters, we can find the length of the pen (P):
P = L - 2
P = 12 - 2
P = 10 centimeters

Now we can find the length of the rubber (R) using the pen's length:
P = R + 3
10 = R + 3
R = 10 - 3
R = 7 centimeters

Now, let's find the length of the marker (M) and the crayon (C):
1. The marker is 1 centimeter longer than the pencil: M = L + 1
M = 12 + 1
M = 13 centimeters

2. The crayon is 2 centimeters shorter than the rubber: C = R - 2
C = 7 - 2
C = 5 centimeters

2. Total produce of apples = 2 * Total produce of mangoes = 2 * 400 kg = 800 kg
3. Total produce of oranges = Total produce of mangoes + 200 kg = 400 kg + 200 kg = 600 kg
4. Total produce of bananas = Total produce of apples - 100 kg = 800 kg - 100 kg = 700 kg
5. Total produce of peaches = 1/2 * Total produce of oranges = 1/2 * 600 kg = 300 kg

Now, let's calculate the total produce of all fruits:

Total produce = Total produce of apples + Total produce of mangoes + Total produce of oranges + Total produce of bananas + Total produce of peaches
Total produce = 800 kg + 400 kg + 600 kg + 700 kg + 300 kg
Total produce = 2800 kg

Since Mr. Sergio sold the fruits at $50 per kg, the total amount of money he got in that season is:

Total amount of money = Total produce * Price per kg
Total amount of money = 2800 kg * $50/kg
Total amount of money = $140,000

So, the final answer is:

There is also a monthly cost of $1000 per person. There is also an annual maintenance fee of $600 per person. Each person also pays $50 per month for gym access. John agrees to pay half the total cost for the whole family. How much does John pay for the first year?,34400.0," First, let's calculate the total cost for the whole family for the first year.

The initial joining fee for the family is 4 people * $4000 = $16000.

The monthly cost for the family is 4 people * $1000 = $4000 per month. For a year, this would be $4000 * 12 = $48000.

The annual maintenance fee for the family is 4 people * $600 = $2400.

The monthly gym access cost for the family is 4 people * $50 = $200 per month. For a year, this would be $200 * 12 = $2400.

Now, let's add all these costs together to get the total cost for the first year:

Total cost = Initial joining fee + Monthly cost for a year + Annual maintenance fee + Monthly gym access cost for a year
Total cost = $16000 + $48000 + $2400 + $2400
Total cost = $68800

John agrees to pay half of this total cost, so:

John's payment = Total cost / 2
John's payment = $68800 / 2
John's payment = $34400

So, John pays $34400 for the first year.

Savanna National park has 20 more elephants than Safari National park. How many animals in total does Savanna National park have?",575.0," Let's calculate the number of animals in Safari National Park first:

- Lions: 100
- Snakes: 100 / 2 = 50
- Giraffes: 50 - 10 = 40
- Zebras: 2 * 40 = 80
- Elephants: 50 - 5 = 45

Now, let's calculate the number of animals in Savanna National Park:

- Lions: 100 * 2 = 200
- Snakes: 50 * 3 = 150
- Giraffes: 40 + 20 = 60
- Zebras: 200 / 2 = 100
- Elephants: 45 + 20 = 65

Now, let's add up all the animals in Savanna National Park:

200 (lions) + 150 (snakes) + 60 (giraffes) + 100 (zebras) + 65 (elephants) = 575

He also buys 4 alpacas that cost 25% less each than a llama. He buys 2 zebras that cost twice as much as a goat each. How much did he spend?,8200.0," First, let's calculate the cost of the goats. Tim buys 3 goats at $400 each, so the total cost for the goats is:
3 goats * $400/goat = $1200

Next, let's find out the cost of each llama. Since llamas cost 50% more than goats, each llama costs:
$400 + (50% of $400) = $400 + $200 = $600

Tim gets twice as many llamas as goats, so he buys:
2 * 3 goats = 6 llamas

The total cost for the llamas is:
6 llamas * $600/llama = $3600

Now, let's calculate the cost of each alpaca. Alpacas cost 25% less than llamas, so each alpaca costs:
$600 - (25% of $600) = $600 - $150 = $450

Tim buys 4 alpacas, so the total cost for the alpacas is:
4 alpacas * $450/alpaca = $1800

Finally, let's find out the cost of each zebra. Zebras cost twice as much as goats, so each zebra costs:
2 * $400 = $800

Tim buys 2 zebras, so the total cost for the zebras is:
2 zebras * $800/zebra = $1600

Now, let's add up all the costs to find the total amount Tim spent:
Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of llamas + Cost of alpacas + Cost of zebras
Total cost = $1200 + $3600 + $1800 + $1600
Total cost = $8200

So, Tim spent a total of $8200 on animals for his zoo.

Next, Zelda the zany zebra stands on her back legs for 4 minutes more than Pulsar. What is the combined length of time, in minutes, that all the entertainers mentioned stand on their back legs?",74.0," Let's calculate the time each entertainer stands on their back legs:

1. Pulsar stands on his back legs for 10 minutes.

2. Polly stands on her back legs for three times as long as Pulsar, so:
   Polly's time = 3 * Pulsar's time = 3 * 10 minutes = 30 minutes.

3. Petra stands on her back legs for one-sixth as long as Polly, so:
   Petra's time = 1/6 * Polly's time = 1/6 * 30 minutes = 5 minutes.

4. Marvin stands on his back legs for half as long as Polly, so:
   Marvin's time = 1/2 * Polly's time = 1/2 * 30 minutes = 15 minutes.

5. Zelda stands on her back legs for 4 minutes more than Pulsar, so:
   Zelda's time = Pulsar's time + 4 minutes = 10 minutes + 4 minutes = 14 minutes.

Now, let's add up the time for all the entertainers:

Total time = Pulsar's time + Polly's time + Petra's time + Marvin's time + Zelda's time
Total time = 10 minutes + 30 minutes + 5 minutes + 15 minutes + 14 minutes

Distance with one sail = Speed with one sail × Time
Distance with one sail = 25 knots × 4 hours
Distance with one sail = 100 nautical miles

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled with two sails for 4 hours at a speed of 50 knots.

Distance with two sails = Speed with two sails × Time
Distance with two sails = 50 knots × 4 hours
Distance with two sails = 200 nautical miles

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled with three sails for 1 hour at a speed of 60 knots.

Distance with three sails = Speed with three sails × Time
Distance with three sails = 60 knots × 1 hour
Distance with three sails = 60 nautical miles

Finally, let's calculate the distance traveled with four sails for 2 hours at a speed of 70 knots.

Distance with four sails = Speed with four sails × Time
Distance with four sails = 70 knots × 2 hours
Distance with four sails = 140 nautical miles

Now, let's add up all the distances in nautical miles:

Total distance in nautical miles = Distance with one sail + Distance with two sails + Distance with three sails + Distance with four sails
Total distance in nautical miles = 100 + 200 + 60 + 140
Total distance in nautical miles = 400 nautical miles

To convert the total distance from nautical miles to land miles, we use the conversion factor 1 nautical mile = 1.15 land miles.

Total distance in land miles = Total distance in nautical miles × Conversion factor
Total distance in land miles = 400 nautical miles × 1.15 land miles/nautical mile

Tenly's stuffed animals = 68 + 5
Tenly's stuffed animals = 73

Now, let's find out how many stuffed animals Riley has. Riley has 10 fewer than Tenly, so we subtract 10 from Tenly's number:

Riley's stuffed animals = Tenly's stuffed animals - 10
Riley's stuffed animals = 73 - 10
Riley's stuffed animals = 63

Finally, let's find out how many stuffed animals Avery has. Avery has half as many as Kenley, so we divide Kenley's number by 2:

Avery's stuffed animals = Kenley's stuffed animals / 2
Avery's stuffed animals = 68 / 2
Avery's stuffed animals = 34

7 (Jessica) + 4 (Tori) + 4 (Lily) + 7 (Patrice) + 3 (Ava) + 7 (Monique) = 32 letters

Since each jelly bracelet costs $2, we multiply the total number of letters by the cost per bracelet:

32 letters * $2/bracelet = $64

So, Robin will spend \boxed{64} dollars on jelly bracelets.",64,64.0,True,
11,mathstral-7b,mistralai/Mathstral-7B-v0.1,2,49,48,Monroe has a collection of ants and a collection of spiders. He has 8 spiders and 12 ants. He also has 5 beetles. He also has 3 scorpions. What is the total number of legs in his entire collection?,190.0," To find the total number of legs in Monroe's collection, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of insect and then sum them up.

Spiders have 8 legs each, so 8 spiders have a total of 8 * 8 = 64 legs.
Ants have 6 legs each, so 12 ants have a total of 12 * 6 = 72 legs.
Beetles have 6 legs each, so 5 beetles have a total of 5 * 6 = 30 legs.
Scorpions have 8 legs each, so 3 scorpions have a total of 3 * 8 = 24 legs.

Now, we add up all the legs:
64 (spider legs) + 72 (ant legs) + 30 (beetle legs) + 24 (scorpion legs) = 190 legs.

Therefore, the total number of legs in Monroe's entire collection is $\boxed{190}$ .",190,190.0,True,
11,mathstral-7b,mistralai/Mathstral-7B-v0.1,2,50,49,"A gumball machine has red, green, and blue gumballs. The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs. For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs. The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",77.0," Let's calculate the number of each color of gumballs based on the information provided:

1. Red gumballs: 16 (given)
2. Blue gumballs: Half as many as red gumballs, so 16 / 2 = 8
3. Green gumballs: 4 times as many as blue gumballs, so 8 * 4 = 32
4. Yellow gumballs: As many as blue gumballs, so 8
5. Purple gumballs: 3 fewer than red gumballs, so 16 - 3 = 13

Now, let's add up all the gumballs:

Red + Blue + Green + Yellow + Purple = 16 + 8 + 32 + 8 + 13 = 77

So, the machine has a total of 77 gumballs.

The final answer is $\boxed{77}$.",77,77.0,True,
