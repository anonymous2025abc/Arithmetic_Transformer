On Thursday it rained 1 inches. He can sell water for $1.2 per gallon. How much money did he make from selling all the water?,180.0," To find out how much money the person made from selling all the water, we need to multiply the total amount of rain collected by the price per gallon.

On Monday, the person collected 4 inches of rain, which is equal to 4 x 15.0 = 60.0 gallons. Since he can sell water for $1.2 per gallon, he made $60.0 x $1.2 = $72.0 from selling the water collected on Monday.

On Tuesday, the person collected 3 inches of rain, which is equal to 3 x 15.0 = 45.0 gallons. Since he can sell water for $1.2 per gallon, he made $45.0 x $1.2 = $54.0 from selling the water collected on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, the person collected 2 inches of rain, which is equal to 2 x 15.0 = 30.0 gallons. Since he can sell water for $1.2 per gallon, he made $30.0 x $1.2 = $36.0 from selling the water collected on Wednesday.

On Thursday, the person collected 1 inch of rain, which is equal to 1 x 15.0 = 15.0 gallons. Since he can sell water for $1.2 per gallon, he made $15.0 x $1.2 = $18.0 from selling the water collected on Thursday.

Adding up the total amount of money made from selling all the water, we get:

Let's start by using the information that there are 40 red candies, 20 less than three times as many yellow candies as red candies. This means that there are 3(40) = 120 yellow candies.

Since half as many blue candies as yellow candies were left, there are 120 / 2 = 60 blue candies left.

Since half as many green candies as red candies were left, there are 40 / 2 = 20 green candies left.

Finally, there are 10 less than five times as many purple candies as yellow candies, which means there are 5(120) - 10 = 600 purple candies left.

Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats, so if she brings x treats, she brings 75% of x pieces of bread.

Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane, so if Jane brings x treats, Wanda brings x/2 treats.
Wanda also brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, so if she brings x pieces of bread, she brings 3x treats.

Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane, so if Jane brings x treats, Carlos brings x/3 treats.
Carlos also brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats, so if he brings x pieces of bread, he brings 2x treats.

Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda, so if Wanda brings x treats, Mia brings x-10 treats.
Mia also brings half as many pieces of bread as treats, so if she brings x pieces of bread, she brings x/2 treats.

Now, we can use the information given in the problem to find the total number of pieces of bread and treats brought by everyone to the zoo:

Jane brings x pieces of bread and x treats.
Wanda brings x/2 pieces of bread and x treats.
Carlos brings 2x pieces of bread and x/3 treats.
Mia brings x-10 treats and x/2 pieces of bread.

So, the total number of pieces of bread and treats brought to the zoo is:

1. Jane visited 6 more than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Han. So, Jane visited 6 + 2 = 8 more rehabilitation centers than Han.
2. Han visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude did. So, Han visited 2 x 2 = 4 fewer rehabilitation centers than Jude did.
3. Jude visited half as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa did. So, Jude visited 1/2 x 6 = 3 fewer rehabilitation centers than Lisa did.
4. Omar visited 3 more rehabilitation centers than Jude did. So, Omar visited 3 + 3 = 6 more rehabilitation centers than Jude did.
5. Priya visited 1 less than three times as many rehabilitation centers as Han did. So, Priya visited 1/3 x 6 = 2 fewer rehabilitation centers than Han did.

1. The rubber is 3 centimeters longer than the pen, so the length of the rubber is:

Rubber length = Pen length + 3 cm = 3 cm + 3 cm = 6 cm

2. The pen is 3 centimeters longer than the rubber, so the length of the pen is:

Pen length = Rubber length - 3 cm = 6 cm - 3 cm = 3 cm

3. The pencil is 2 centimeters shorter than the pen, so the length of the pencil is:

Pencil length = Pen length - 2 cm = 3 cm - 2 cm = 1 cm

4. A marker is 1 centimeter longer than the pencil, so the length of the marker is:

Marker length = Pencil length + 1 cm = 1 cm + 1 cm = 2 cm

Emma can run all around the two arenas in 20 hours, so it takes her 20 hours to complete the course.

Fernando takes twice as long as Emma to run the course, so it takes him 40 hours to complete the course (2 x 20 = 40).

Gina takes half as long as Fernando to run the course, so it takes her 20 hours to complete the course (1/2 x 40 = 20).

Harold takes 10 hours more than Emma to run the course, so it takes him 30 hours to complete the course (10 + 20 = 30).

If his farm produced 400 kg of mangoes and he sold the fruits at $50 per kg, calculate the total amount of money he got in that season.",140000.0," To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the passage to find the total produce of each fruit and then calculate the total amount of money Mr. Sergio got from selling his fruits.

Let's start by using the information given in the passage:

* The total produce of apples was twice the total produce of mangoes. So, if the total produce of apples was 400 kg, the total produce of mangoes was 200 kg.
* The total produce of oranges was 200 kg more than that of mangoes. So, the total produce of oranges was 600 kg (200 kg + 200 kg).
* He produced 100 kg fewer bananas than apples. So, the total produce of bananas was 300 kg (400 kg - 100 kg).
* The total produce of peaches was half the total produce of oranges. So, the total produce of peaches was 300 kg (600 kg / 2 = 300 kg).

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Mr. Sergio got from selling his fruits:

* He sold the apples at $50 per kg, so the total amount of money he got from selling apples was 400 kg x $50 per kg = $20,000.
* He sold the mangoes at $50 per kg, so the total amount of money he got from selling mangoes was 200 kg x $50 per kg = $10,000.
* He sold the oranges at $40 per kg, so the total amount of money he got from selling oranges was 600 kg x $40 per kg = $24,000.
* He sold the bananas at $30 per kg, so the total amount of money he got from selling bananas was 300 kg x $30 per kg = $9,000.
* He sold the peaches at $35 per kg, so the total amount of money he got from selling peaches was 300 kg x $35 per kg = $10,500.

Adding up the total amount of money he got from selling each fruit, we get:

$20,000 + $10,000 + $24,000 + $9,000 + $10,500 = $64,500

On the other hand, Savanna National park has double as many lions as Safari National park, triple as many snakes as Safari National park, and 20 more giraffes than Safari National park. Safari National park also has twice as many zebras as giraffes. Savanna National park has half as many zebras as lions. Safari National park also has 5 fewer elephants than snakes. Savanna National park has 20 more elephants than Safari National park. How many animals in total does Savanna National park have?",575.0," To solve this problem, we need to gather information about the number of animals in each park and then use that information to calculate the total number of animals in Savanna National park.

We know that Safari National park has 100 lions, half as many snakes, and 10 fewer giraffes than snakes. This means that Safari National park has 50 snakes and 90 giraffes.

We also know that Savanna National park has double as many lions as Safari National park, triple as many snakes as Safari National park, and 20 more giraffes than Safari National park. This means that Savanna National park has 200 lions, 150 snakes, and 110 giraffes.

We also know that Safari National park has twice as many zebras as giraffes, so Safari National park has 20 zebras for every 1 giraffe. This means that Safari National park has 20 x 110 = 2200 zebras.

Finally, we know that Savanna National park has half as many zebras as lions, so Savanna National park has 50 zebras for every 1 lion. This means that Savanna National park has 50 x 200 = 10,000 zebras.

To find the total number of animals in Savanna National park, we need to add up the number of lions, snakes, giraffes, and zebras. This gives us:

100 + 50 + 110 + 10,000 = 12,650

Therefore, Savanna National park has 12,650 animals in total.","12,650",12650.0,False,

1. Pulsar stands on his back legs for 10 minutes.
2. Polly stands on her back legs for 3 times as long as Pulsar, which is 30 minutes (10 x 3 = 30).
3. Petra stands on his back legs for 1/6th as long as Polly, which is 5 minutes (30 / 6 = 5).
4. Marvin the mischievous monkey stands on his back legs for half as long as Polly, which is 15 minutes (30 / 2 = 15).
5. Zelda the zany zebra stands on her back legs for 4 minutes more than Pulsar, which is 4 + 10 = 14 minutes.

Under the same conditions, the use of four sails brings the ship to the speed of 70 knots, and she sails for 2 hours using four sails. what is the total distance, in land miles, that she will travel?",575.0," To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the problem to find the speed of Buffy's sailboat under different conditions, and then use that information to calculate the total distance traveled.

1. Under optimal wind conditions, the use of two sails brings the ship to the speed of 50 knots, which is equal to 55.55 land miles per hour (1 nautical mile = 1.15 land miles).
2. Under optimal wind conditions, the use of one sail brings the ship to the speed of 25 knots, which is equal to 28.28 land miles per hour (1 nautical mile = 1.15 land miles).
3. Buffy sails for 4 hours with one sail and then for another 4 hours with two sails. To find the total distance traveled, we need to multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 28.28 land miles/hour x 4 hours = 112.12 land miles

4. Under optimal wind conditions, the use of three sails brings the ship to the speed of 60 knots, which is equal to 67.78 land miles per hour (1 nautical mile = 1.15 land miles).
5. Buffy sails for 1 hour using three sails. To find the distance traveled, we need to multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 67.78 land miles/hour x 1 hour = 67.78 land miles

6. Under optimal wind conditions, the use of four sails brings the ship to the speed of 70 knots, which is equal to 78.41 land miles per hour (1 nautical mile = 1.15 land miles).
7. Buffy sails for 2 hours using four sails. To find the distance traveled, we need to multiply the speed by the time:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 78.41 land miles/hour x 2 hours = 156.82 land miles

Therefore, the total distance traveled by Buffy in her sailboat under optimal wind conditions is:

He also bought 4 kilos of rice for $6 per kilo, 2 kilos of onions for $3 per kilo. How much is Peter's remaining money?",396.0," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of all the items Peter bought and then subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money he carried.

Cost of potatoes = 6 kilos x $2 per kilo = $12
Cost of tomatoes = 9 kilos x $3 per kilo = $27
Cost of cucumbers = 5 kilos x $4 per kilo = $20
Cost of bananas = 3 kilos x $5 per kilo = $15
Cost of rice = 4 kilos x $6 per kilo = $24
Cost of onions = 2 kilos x $3 per kilo = $6

Total cost = $12 + $27 + $20 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $104

How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",9.0," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of lasagna that each person will eat, taking into account their individual preferences and the number of people eating.

1. Manny: Manny wants one piece, so he will eat 1/5 of the lasagna.
2. Aaron: Aaron doesn't like lasagna, so he will eat garlic bread and salad, which means he won't eat any lasagna.
3. Kai: Kai is always hungry, so he will eat twice as much as Manny, which means he will eat 2 x 1/5 = 2/5 of the lasagna.
4. Raphael: Raphael will eat half the amount Manny does, so he will eat 1/2 x 1/5 = 1/10 of the lasagna.
5. Lisa: Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. So, she will eat 2 + (1/10) = 3/10 of the lasagna.
6. Nora: Nora is picky and will only eat one-third of what Manny eats, so she will eat 1/3 x 1/5 = 1/15 of the lasagna.
