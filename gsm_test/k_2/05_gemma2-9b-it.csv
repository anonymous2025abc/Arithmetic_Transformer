If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",315.0,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Find Jane's treats:**

* Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, and this is three times the number of treats she brings.
* Wanda's treats: 90 pieces of bread / 3 = 30 treats

* Jane brings 75% as many treats as Wanda, so Jane brings: 30 treats * 0.75 = 22.5 treats

**2. Find Carlos' treats and bread:**

* Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane: 22.5 treats / 3 = 7.5 treats
* Carlos brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats: 7.5 treats * 2 = 15 pieces of bread

**3. Find Mia's treats and bread:**

* Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda: 30 treats - 10 treats = 20 treats
* Mia brings half as many pieces of bread as treats: 20 treats / 2 = 10 pieces of bread

**4. Calculate the total treats and bread:**

* **Treats:** 30 (Wanda) + 22.5 (Jane) + 7.5 (Carlos) + 20 (Mia) = 80 treats
* **Bread:** 90 (Wanda) + 15 (Carlos) + 10 (Mia) = 115 pieces of bread

If Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers, how many rehabilitation centers did they all visit in total, assuming they are all different?",44.0,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Jude's visits:** Jude visited half as many centers as Lisa, who visited 6, so Jude visited 6 / 2 = 3 rehabilitation centers.

2. **Han's visits:** Han visited 2 less than twice the number Jude visited, so Han visited (2 * 3) - 2 = 4 rehabilitation centers.

3. **Jane's visits:** Jane visited 6 more than twice the number Han visited, so Jane visited (2 * 4) + 6 = 14 rehabilitation centers.

4. **Omar's visits:** Omar visited 3 more centers than Jude, so Omar visited 3 + 3 = 6 rehabilitation centers.

He needs to know how many pieces to cut the lasagna into to serve it. Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Another friend, Nora, is picky and will only eat one-third of what Manny eats, and Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. Another friend, Ben, will eat the same amount of lasagna as Kai. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",9.0,"Here's how to figure out how many pieces of lasagna Manny needs:

* **Manny:** 1 piece
* **Kai:** 1 * 2 = 2 pieces
* **Raphael:** 1 / 2 = 0.5 pieces (round up to 1 since you can't have half a piece)
* **Lisa:** 2 pieces + 0.5 pieces (Raphael's leftovers) = 2.5 pieces (round up to 3 since you can't have half a piece)
* **Nora:** 1 / 3 = 0.33 pieces (round up to 1 since you can't have part of a piece)

How much did he spend total on buying t-shirts?",1420.0,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate the cost of women's t-shirts:**

* White women's t-shirt: $20 - $5 = $15
* Black women's t-shirt: $18 - $5 = $13
* Blue women's t-shirt: $22 - $5 = $17
* Red women's t-shirt: $21 - $5 = $16

**2. Calculate the cost of t-shirts for each sector:**

* White sector: (10 men * $20) + (10 women * $15) = $200 + $150 = $350
* Black sector: (10 men * $18) + (10 women * $13) = $180 + $130 = $310
* Blue sector: (10 men * $22) + (10 women * $17) = $220 + $170 = $390
