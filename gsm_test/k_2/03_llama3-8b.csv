There were 40 red candies, 20 less than three times as many yellow candies as red candies, and half as many blue candies as yellow candies. There were also half as many green candies as red candies. There were also 10 less than five times as many purple candies as yellow candies. If Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, how many candies remained?",600.0,"40

Explanation:
Let the number of red candies be x.
Then the number of yellow candies is 3x-20.
The number of blue candies is 3x-20/2 = 3x-10.
The number of green candies is x/2.
The number of purple candies is 5(3x-20)-10 = 15x-130.
The total number of candies is 40 + 3x-20 + 3x-10 + x/2 + 15x-130 = 15x-40.
If Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, then the number of candies remaining is 15x-40 - 3x-20 = 12x-60.
Since 12x-60 is divisible by 12, the remainder is 0.
Therefore, the number of candies remaining is 0.",0,0.0,False,

She decided to count each animal she saw and calculated their total number. She counted 80 antelopes, 34 more rabbits than antelopes, 42 fewer hyenas than the total number of antelopes and rabbits combined, 50 more wild dogs than hyenas, and the number of leopards was half the number of rabbits. There were also twice as many zebras as leopards. There were also 3 fewer giraffes than zebras. What is the total number of animals that Josie counted?",830.0,"0.5

Explanation:
Let the number of antelopes be x.
The number of rabbits is x + 34.
The number of hyenas is x + x + 34 - 42 = 2x + 32.
The number of wild dogs is 2x + 32 + 50 = 2x + 82.
The number of leopards is (x + 34)/2 = (x + 34)/2.
The number of zebras is 2(x + 34)/2 = x + 34.
The number of giraffes is x + 34 - 3 = x + 31.
The total number of animals is x + x + 34 + 2x + 32 + 2x + 82 + (x + 34)/2 + x + 34 + x + 31 = 7x + 234.

3,llama3-8b,meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B,2,19,18,"From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. Tom collected three times as many red marbles as Mary. Tom collected 5 fewer blue marbles than Jenny. Sara collected 10 fewer red marbles than Anie. Sara collected five times as many blue marbles as Mary. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?",245.0,"100

Explanation:
Let's start by assigning variables to the number of red and blue marbles collected by each friend. We'll use the following variables:
• Rm = number of red marbles collected by Mary
• Rj = number of red marbles collected by Jenny
• Rt = number of red marbles collected by Tom
• Rsa = number of red marbles collected by Sara
• Rn = number of red marbles collected by Anie
• Bm = number of blue marbles collected by Mary
• Bj = number of blue marbles collected by Jenny
• Bt = number of blue marbles collected by Tom
• Bsa = number of blue marbles collected by Sara
• Bn = number of blue marbles collected by Anie
We're given that Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles. We can use this information to write the following equations:
Rj = 30
Bj = 25
We're also given that Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. We can use this information to write the following equations:
Rn = Rm + 20
Bn = 2 * Bj
We're also given that Tom collected three times as many red marbles as Mary. We can use this information to write the following equation:
Rt = 3 * Rm
We're also given that Tom collected 5 fewer blue marbles than Jenny. We can use this information to write the following equation:
Bt = Bj - 5
We're also given that Sara collected 10 fewer red marbles than Anie. We can use this information to write the following equation:
Rsa = Rn - 10
We're also given that Sara collected five times as many blue marbles as Mary. We can use this information to write the following equation:
Bsa = 5 * Bm
We can now solve the problem by substituting the values of the variables into the equations and solving for the unknown variables. We'll start by solving for Rm, Rn, Bm, and Bn. We can do this by substituting the values of the variables into the equations and solving for the unknown variables. We'll start by solving for Rm, Rn, Bm, and Bn.

Explanation:
Borgnine wants to see 1100 legs at the zoo. He has already seen 12 chimps, 8 lions, and 5 lizards. He also saw 8 penguins. He also saw 6 elephants. He is next headed to see the tarantulas. How many tarantulas does he need to see to meet his goal?

The number of legs of each animal is as follows:

Chimps: 4 legs
Lions: 4 legs
Lizards: 4 legs
Penguins: 2 legs
Elephants: 4 legs
Tarantulas: 8 legs

The total number of legs Borgnine has seen is:

12 chimps + 8 lions + 5 lizards + 8 penguins + 6 elephants = 39 legs

The number of legs Borgnine needs to see is:

1100 - 39 = 1061 legs

Explanation:
The total length of the rubber, the pen, the pencil, and all the other stationery items mentioned altogether is 36 centimeters.

The length of the pencil is 12 centimeters.
The length of the pen is 12 centimeters + 3 centimeters = 15 centimeters.
The length of the rubber is 15 centimeters + 2 centimeters = 17 centimeters.
The length of the marker is 12 centimeters + 1 centimeter = 13 centimeters.
The length of the crayon is 17 centimeters - 2 centimeters = 15 centimeters.
The total length of the rubber, the pen, the pencil, and all the other stationery items mentioned altogether is 15 centimeters + 17 centimeters + 13 centimeters + 15 centimeters = 60 centimeters.

Explanation:
Let the ages of the three oldest brothers be x, x+1, and x+2. Then, we have the following system of equations:

Explanation:
Tim buys 3 goats for $400 each. He gets twice as many llamas which cost 50% more each. He also buys 4 alpacas that cost 25% less each than a llama. He buys 2 zebras that cost twice as much as a goat each. The total cost of the goats is 3 x $400 = $1,200. The total cost of the llamas is 2 x 1.5 x $400 = $1,200. The total cost of the alpacas is 4 x 0.75 x $400 = $900. The total cost of the zebras is 2 x 2 x $400 = $1,600. The total cost of all the animals is $1,200 + $1,200 + $900 + $1,600 = $4,900.","4,900",4900.0,False,

Problem:
The sum of the digits of a two-digit number is 9. If the digits are reversed, the new number is 18 more than the original number. What is the original number?

Answer:
#### Let the tens digit be x and the units digit be y. Then, x + y = 9 and 10x + y = 10y + 18. Subtracting the second equation from the first gives 9x = 18, so x = 2 and y = 7. The original number is 27.

He also bought 4 kilos of rice for $6 per kilo, 2 kilos of onions for $3 per kilo. How much is Peter's remaining money?",396.0,"0.00

Explanation:
Peter's total money is $500.
He bought 6 kilos of potatoes for $2 per kilo, 9 kilos of tomato for $3 per kilo, 5 kilos of cucumbers for $4 per kilo, and 3 kilos of bananas for $5 per kilo.
6 kilos of potatoes = 6 x 2 = 12
9 kilos of tomato = 9 x 3 = 27
5 kilos of cucumbers = 5 x 4 = 20
3 kilos of bananas = 3 x 5 = 15
Total = 12 + 27 + 20 + 15 = 74
He also bought 4 kilos of rice for $6 per kilo, 2 kilos of onions for $3 per kilo.

For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs. The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",77.0,"48

Explanation:
Let the number of red gumballs be x.
The number of blue gumballs is half of the number of red gumballs, so the number of blue gumballs is x/2.
The number of green gumballs is 4 times the number of blue gumballs, so the number of green gumballs is 4x/2 = 2x.
The number of yellow gumballs is the same as the number of blue gumballs, so the number of yellow gumballs is x/2.
The number of purple gumballs is 3 fewer than the number of red gumballs, so the number of purple gumballs is x - 3.
The total number of gumballs is the sum of the number of red, blue, green, yellow, and purple gumballs, so the total number of gumballs is x + x/2 + 2x + x/2 + x - 3 = 5x - 3.
The problem states that the machine has 16 red gumballs, so x = 16.
Substituting x = 16 into the equation for the total number of gumballs gives 5(16) - 3 = 80 - 3 = 77.
The machine has 77 gumballs.",77,77.0,True,
