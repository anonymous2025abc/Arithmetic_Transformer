Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, so let \( B_W \) be the number of pieces of bread Wanda brought. We already know \( B_W = 90 \).

Carlos brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats, so let \( B_C \) be the number of pieces of bread Carlos brought. Then:
\[ B_C = 2T_C \]
Since \( T_C = 20 \):
\[ B_C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

Mia brings half as many pieces of bread as treats, so let \( B_M \) be the number of pieces of bread Mia brought. Then:
\[ B_M = \frac{T_M}{2} \]

How old is the youngest brother?,29.0,"To determine the age of the youngest brother, we start by defining the ages of the three oldest brothers. Let the age of the youngest brother be \( x \). Since the ages are consecutive integers, the age of the middle brother is \( x+1 \) and the age of the oldest brother is \( x+2 \).

The sum of their ages is given as 96. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 96
\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[
3x + 3 = 96
\]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[
3x = 93
\]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[
x = 31
\]

So, the youngest brother is 31 years old. The middle brother is \( x+1 = 32 \) years old, and the oldest brother is \( x+2 = 33 \) years old.

Now, we need to find the ages of Liam and Noah. Liam is 1 year younger than the youngest brother, so Liam is:
\[
31 - 1 = 30

Noah is 1 year younger than Liam, so Noah is:
\[
30 - 1 = 29

The youngest brother is Noah, who is 29 years old. Therefore, the final answer is:

There is also a monthly cost of $1000 per person. There is also an annual maintenance fee of $600 per person. Each person also pays $50 per month for gym access. John agrees to pay half the total cost for the whole family. How much does John pay for the first year?,34400.0,"To determine how much John pays for the first year, we need to calculate the total cost for the family and then find out how much John pays, which is half of the total cost.

First, let's calculate the initial joining fee for the family. Since there are 4 members and the joining fee per person is $4000, the total joining fee is:
\[ 4 \times 4000 = 16000 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the monthly cost for the family. The monthly cost per person is $1000, and there are 4 members. The total monthly cost is:
\[ 4 \times 1000 = 4000 \text{ dollars per month} \]
Since there are 12 months in a year, the total annual cost for the monthly fees is:
\[ 4000 \times 12 = 48000 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's calculate the annual maintenance fee for the family. The annual maintenance fee per person is $600, and there are 4 members. The total annual maintenance fee is:
\[ 4 \times 600 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Next, let's calculate the annual cost for gym access for the family. The monthly cost per person for gym access is $50, and there are 4 members. The total monthly cost for gym access is:
\[ 4 \times 50 = 200 \text{ dollars per month} \]
Since there are 12 months in a year, the total annual cost for gym access is:
\[ 200 \times 12 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

Now, let's add up all the costs to find the total cost for the family for the first year:
\[ 16000 + 48000 + 2400 + 2400 = 68800 \text{ dollars} \]

Since John agrees to pay half of the total cost, we need to divide the total cost by 2:
\[ \frac{68800}{2} = 34400 \text{ dollars} \]

Therefore, the amount John pays for the first year is:

- The number of snakes in Savanna National park is triple as many as the snakes in Safari National park, so:
  \[
  \text{Snakes in Savanna National park} = 3 \times 50 = 150

First, convert all terms to fractions with a common denominator. The common denominator for 1, 0.5, 2.5, and \(\frac{1}{3}\) is 6:
\[
1 = \frac{6}{6}, \quad 0.5 = \frac{3}{6}, \quad 2.5 = \frac{15}{6}, \quad \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{6}
\]

Now, sum the fractions:
\[
\text{Total consumption} = \frac{6}{6} + \frac{0}{6} + \frac{12}{6} + \frac{3}{6} + \frac{15}{6} + \frac{2}{6} + \frac{12}{6}

\[
\text{Total consumption} = \frac{6 + 0 + 12 + 3 + 15 + 2 + 12}{6}
\]
\[
\text{Total consumption} = \frac{50}{6}
\]
\[
\text{Total consumption} = \frac{25}{3} \approx 8.33

Her friends are Jessica, Tori, Lily, Patrice, Ava, and Monique. If each jelly bracelet costs $2, what is the total she will spend in dollars?",64.0,"To determine the total amount Robin will spend on jelly bracelets, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of letters in each friend's first name.
2. Sum the total number of letters for all friends.
3. Multiply the total number of letters by the cost of each jelly bracelet.

Let's start with the first step:

- Jessica has 7 letters.
- Tori has 4 letters.
- Lily has 4 letters.
- Patrice has 7 letters.
- Ava has 4 letters.
- Monique has 7 letters.

Next, we sum the total number of letters:

\[ 7 + 4 + 4 + 7 + 4 + 7 = 36 \]

Now, we multiply the total number of letters by the cost of each jelly bracelet, which is $2:

\[ 36 \times 2 = 72 \]

1. **Spiders**: Each spider has 8 legs. Monroe has 8 spiders.
   \[
   8 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs per spider} = 64 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. **Ants**: Each ant has 6 legs. Monroe has 12 ants.
   \[
   12 \text{ ants} \times 6 \text{ legs per ant} = 72 \text{ legs}
