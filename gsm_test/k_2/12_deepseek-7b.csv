There were also 10 less than five times as many purple candies as yellow candies. If Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, how many candies remained?",600.0," Let's break down the problem:

1. Maria has 40 red candies.
2. The number of yellow candies is 20 less than three times the number of red candies. So, we can write this as: yellow candies = 3 * red candies - 20. Substituting the value of red candies, we get: yellow candies = 3 * 40 - 20 = 120 - 20 = 100.
3. The number of blue candies is half as many as yellow candies. So, we can write this as: blue candies = yellow candies / 2. Substituting the value of yellow candies, we get: blue candies = 100 / 2 = 50.
4. The number of green candies is half as many as red candies. So, we can write this as: green candies = red candies / 2. Substituting the value of red candies, we get: green candies = 40 / 2 = 20.
5. The number of purple candies is 10 less than five times the number of yellow candies. So, we can write this as: purple candies = 5 * yellow candies - 10. Substituting the value of yellow candies, we get: purple candies = 5 * 100 - 10 = 500 - 10 = 490.

Now, let's add up all the candies: total candies = red candies + yellow candies + blue candies + green candies + purple candies = 40 + 100 + 50 + 20 + 490 = 600.

If Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, then the number of candies remaining is: remaining candies = total candies - yellow candies = 600 - 100 = 500.

The living room walls take up 600 square feet.

The bedroom walls take up 400 square feet each, and there are 3 of them, so the total square footage of the bedroom walls is 400 * 3 = 1200 square feet.

The kitchen walls take up 500 square feet each, and there are 6 of them, so the total square footage of the kitchen walls is 500 * 6 = 3000 square feet.

- Chopping peppers: It takes him 3 minutes to chop a pepper, and he needs to chop 4 peppers. So, he spends 3 minutes/pepper * 4 peppers = 12 minutes on chopping peppers.
- Chopping onions: It takes him 4 minutes to chop an onion, and he needs to chop 2 onions. So, he spends 4 minutes/onion * 2 onions = 8 minutes on chopping onions.
- Grating cheese: It takes him 1 minute to grate enough cheese for one omelet, and he needs to grate cheese for 5 omelets. So, he spends 1 minute/omelet * 5 omelets = 5 minutes on grating cheese.
- Assembling and cooking omelets: It takes him 5 minutes to assemble and cook one omelet, and he needs to cook 5 omelets. So, he spends 5 minutes/omelet * 5 omelets = 25 minutes on assembling and cooking omelets.
- Chopping tomatoes: It takes him 4 minutes to chop a tomato, and he needs to chop 3 tomatoes. So, he spends 4 minutes/tomato * 3 tomatoes = 12 minutes on chopping tomatoes.
- Slicing mushrooms: It takes him 2 minutes to slice enough mushrooms for one omelet, and he adds mushrooms to each of the 5 omelets. So, he spends 2 minutes/omelet * 5 omelets = 10 minutes on slicing mushrooms.

How many square feet combined are in all their gardens?",652.0," The area of each garden tended by Mancino is 16 feet * 5 feet = 80 square feet.
Since he tends 3 gardens, the total area of the gardens he tends is 80 square feet * 3 = 240 square feet.

The area of each garden tilled by Marquita is 8 feet * 4 feet = 32 square feet.
Since she tills 2 gardens, the total area of the gardens she tills is 32 square feet * 2 = 64 square feet.

The area of each garden worked on by Luis is 10 feet * 6 feet = 60 square feet.
Since he works on 4 gardens, the total area of the gardens he works on is 60 square feet * 4 = 240 square feet.

The area of the garden worked on by Tasha is 12 feet * 9 feet = 108 square feet.

Adding up the areas of all the gardens, we get 240 square feet (Mancino's gardens) + 64 square feet (Marquita's gardens) + 240 square feet (Luis's gardens) + 108 square feet (Tasha's garden) = 652 square feet.

She also adds 5 8-oz cans of ginger ale. Then she pours in 2 15-oz bottles of orange soda. How many 10 oz servings of punch does Carrie have?",21.0," First, let's calculate the total volume of each type of drink that Carrie adds to the punch.

For the Mountain Dew, she adds 6 cans, each of 12 oz. So, the total volume of Mountain Dew is 6 * 12 = 72 oz.

For the ginger ale, she adds 5 cans, each of 8 oz. So, the total volume of ginger ale is 5 * 8 = 40 oz.

For the orange soda, she adds 2 bottles, each of 15 oz. So, the total volume of orange soda is 2 * 15 = 30 oz.

Now, let's add up the total volume of all the drinks that Carrie adds to the punch. The total volume is 72 oz (Mountain Dew) + 28 oz (ice) + 40 oz (fruit juice) + 40 oz (ginger ale) + 30 oz (orange soda) = 210 oz.

Finally, let's calculate how many 10 oz servings of punch Carrie has. To do this, we divide the total volume of the punch by the volume of each serving. So, the number of servings is 210 oz / 10 oz/serving = 21 servings.

Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane and three times as many pieces of bread as treats. Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane and twice as many pieces of bread as treats. Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda and half as many pieces of bread as treats. If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",315.0," Let's denote the number of treats that Jane brings as T_Jane, the number of pieces of bread that Jane brings as B_Jane, the number of treats that Wanda brings as T_Wanda, the number of pieces of bread that Wanda brings as B_Wanda, the number of treats that Carlos brings as T_Carlos, the number of pieces of bread that Carlos brings as B_Carlos, the number of treats that Mia brings as T_Mia, and the number of pieces of bread that Mia brings as B_Mia.

From the problem, we know that:

1. Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats, so B_Jane = 0.75 * T_Jane.
2. Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane, so T_Wanda = 0.5 * T_Jane.
3. Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, so B_Wanda = 3 * T_Wanda.
4. Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane, so T_Carlos = T_Jane / 3.
5. Carlos brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats, so B_Carlos = 2 * T_Carlos.
6. Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda, so T_Mia = T_Wanda - 10.
7. Mia brings half as many pieces of bread as treats, so B_Mia = 0.5 * T_Mia.
8. Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, so B_Wanda = 90.

Now, let's solve these equations step by step:

1. From equation 3, we can find T_Wanda: T_Wanda = B_Wanda / 3 = 90 / 3 = 30.
2. From equation 2, we can find T_Jane: T_Jane = T_Wanda / 0.5 = 30 / 0.5 = 60.
3. From equation 1, we can find B_Jane: B_Jane = 0.75 * T_Jane = 0.75 * 60 = 45.
4. From equation 4, we can find T_Carlos: T_Carlos = T_Jane / 3 = 60 / 3 = 20.
5. From equation 5, we can find B_Carlos: B_Carlos = 2 * T_Carlos = 2 * 20 = 40.
6. From equation 6, we can find T_Mia: T_Mia = T_Wanda - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20.
7. From equation 7, we can find B_Mia: B_Mia = 0.5 * T_Mia = 0.5 * 20 = 10.

Now, let's add up all the pieces of bread and treats that everyone brought:

Total pieces of bread = B_Jane + B_Wanda + B_Carlos + B_Mia = 45 + 90 + 40 + 10 = 185.
Total treats = T_Jane + T_Wanda + T_Carlos + T_Mia = 60 + 30 + 20 + 20 = 130.

12,deepseek-7b,deepseek-ai/deepseek-math-7b-instruct,2,41,40,"Buffy has a sailboat with a planing hull that she sails in the Gulf of Mexico. Under optimal wind conditions, the use of two sails brings the ship to the speed of 50 knots, whereas under the same conditions, the use of one sail brings her ship to the speed of 25 knots. A knot is a nautical term for speed equal to 1 nautical mile per hour, and one nautical mile equals 1.15 land miles. If she travels in her sailboat under optimal wind conditions for 4 hours with one sail and then for another 4 hours with two sails, Under the same conditions, the use of three sails brings the ship to the speed of 60 knots, and she sails for 1 hour using three sails. Under the same conditions, the use of four sails brings the ship to the speed of 70 knots, and she sails for 2 hours using four sails. what is the total distance, in land miles, that she will travel?",575.0," First, we need to convert the speed of the sailboat from knots to land miles per hour. 

1 knot = 1.15 land miles per hour.

So, the speed of the sailboat with one sail is 25 knots * 1.15 = 28.75 land miles per hour.
The speed of the sailboat with two sails is 50 knots * 1.15 = 57.5 land miles per hour.
The speed of the sailboat with three sails is 60 knots * 1.15 = 69 land miles per hour.
The speed of the sailboat with four sails is 70 knots * 1.15 = 79.5 land miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance traveled for each part of the journey.

For the first part of the journey, Buffy sails for 4 hours with one sail at a speed of 28.75 land miles per hour. So, the distance traveled is 4 hours * 28.75 land miles per hour = 115 land miles.

For the second part of the journey, Buffy sails for 4 hours with two sails at a speed of 57.5 land miles per hour. So, the distance traveled is 4 hours * 57.5 land miles per hour = 230 land miles.

For the third part of the journey, Buffy sails for 1 hour with three sails at a speed of 69 land miles per hour. So, the distance traveled is 1 hour * 69 land miles per hour = 69 land miles.

For the fourth part of the journey, Buffy sails for 2 hours with four sails at a speed of 79.5 land miles per hour. So, the distance traveled is 2 hours * 79.5 land miles per hour = 159 land miles.

Finally, we add up the distances traveled in each part of the journey to get the total distance traveled.

Total distance = 115 land miles + 230 land miles + 69 land miles + 159 land miles = 573 land miles.

He needs to know how many pieces to cut the lasagna into to serve it. Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Another friend, Nora, is picky and will only eat one-third of what Manny eats, and Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. Another friend, Ben, will eat the same amount of lasagna as Kai. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",9.0," Let's break down the problem:

1. Manny wants one piece of lasagna.
2. Aaron doesn't want any lasagna.
3. Kai will eat twice as much as Manny.
4. Raphael eats half the amount Manny does.
5. Lisa will eat two pieces, plus any leftovers from Raphael's piece.
6. Nora will eat one-third of what Manny eats.
7. Ben will eat the same amount of lasagna as Kai.

Let's calculate how much lasagna each person will eat:

1. Manny eats 1 piece.
2. Aaron eats 0 pieces.
3. Kai eats twice as much as Manny, so he eats 2 * 1 = 2 pieces.
4. Raphael eats half the amount Manny does, so he eats 0.5 * 1 = 0.5 pieces. Since we can't have half a piece, we'll round up to 1 piece.
5. Lisa eats two pieces, plus any leftovers from Raphael's piece. Since Raphael eats 1 piece, Lisa eats 2 + 1 = 3 pieces.
6. Nora eats one-third of what Manny eats, so she eats 1/3 * 1 = 0.33 pieces. Since we can't have a fraction of a piece, we'll round up to 1 piece.
7. Ben eats the same amount of lasagna as Kai, so he eats 2 pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces:

1 (Manny) + 0 (Aaron) + 2 (Kai) + 1 (Raphael) + 3 (Lisa) + 1 (Nora) + 2 (Ben) = 11 pieces

So, Manny should cut his lasagna into 11 pieces.

For men's t-shirts, he paid $20 for white men's t-shirts, $18 for black men's t-shirts, and $22 for blue men's t-shirts. So, the total cost for men's t-shirts is $20 + $18 + $22 = $60.

How many fish do all the people mentioned have put together?,188.0," Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we know that Billy has 10 fish.

Second, Nina has 2 fewer fish in her aquarium than Billy does. So, Nina has 10 - 2 = 8 fish.

Third, Tony has 3 times as many fish in his aquarium as Billy does. So, Tony has 3 * 10 = 30 fish.

Fourth, Sarah has 5 more fish in her aquarium than Tony does. So, Sarah has 30 + 5 = 35 fish.
