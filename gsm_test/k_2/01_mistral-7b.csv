Next, we'll find the number of sheep Alice has, as she has 5 times as many as Bob. So, Alice has 5 * 20 = 100 sheep.

Then, we'll find the number of sheep Seattle has, as it has 2 times as many as Alice. So, Seattle has 2 * 100 = 200 sheep.

Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, Charleston has 4 * 200 = 800 sheep.

1. Maria had 40 red candies.
2. There were three times as many yellow candies as red candies, so there were 3 * 40 = 120 yellow candies.

There were also twice as many zebras as leopards. There were also 3 fewer giraffes than zebras. What is the total number of animals that Josie counted?",830.0,"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Let A be the number of antelopes, R be the number of rabbits, H be the number of hyenas, W be the number of wild dogs, L be the number of leopards, and Z be the number of zebras.

2. We know that A + R = A + 34 (since there are 34 more rabbits than antelopes).

3. We also know that A + R + H = A + R + A + H (since the total number of antelopes and rabbits is the same as the total number of all animals except hyenas). So, A + R + H = 2A + H.

4. We know that A + R + H + W = A + R + H + A - 42 (since there are 42 fewer hyenas than the total number of antelopes, rabbits, and wild dogs combined). So, A + R + H + W = 2A + H - 42.

5. We know that A + R + H + W + L = A + R + H + W + 0.5R (since the number of leopards is half the number of rabbits). So, A + R + H + W + L = 2A + H - 42 + 0.5R.

6. We know that A + R + H + W + L + Z = A + R + 2L + Z (since there are twice as many zebras as leopards). So, A + R + H + W + L + Z = 2A + H - 42 + 0.5R + 2L + Z.

7. We also know that Z = A + R + 2L + Z - 3 (since there are 3 fewer giraffes than zebras). So, Z - (A + R + 2L) = -3.

8. Now, we have two equations with two variables:

   - A + R = A + 34
   - Z - (A + R + 2L) = -3

9. From the first equation, we can isolate R: R = A + 34 - A = 34.

10. Now, we can find L: L = 0.5R = 0.5 * 34 = 17.

11. Now, we can find Z: Z = A + R + 2L = A + 34 + 2 * 17 = A + 34 + 34 = 2A + 34.

12. Now, we can find H from the second equation of step 3: H = 2A + H - 42. Solving for H, we get H = 42 + 2A.

13. Now, we can find W from the third equation of step 4: W = 2A + H - 42 - R - L = 2A + 42 + 2A - 42 - 34 - 17 = A - 53.

14. Now, we can find the total number of animals: A + R + H + W + L + Z = 2A + H - 42 + 0.5R + 2L + Z = 2A + 42 + 2A - 42 + 34 + 17 + A - 53 = 4A + 54.

So, the total points scored by the Fireflies in the game is 53 + 48 = 101 points, and the total points scored by the Hornets in the game is 80 + 6 = 86 points.

Finally, to find the difference in points, subtract the Hornets' total from the Fireflies' total: 101 - 86 = 15.

So, the Fireflies scored 15 more points than the Hornets in the game.

How many 10 oz servings of punch does Carrie have?",21.0,"First, let's calculate the total volume of all the drinks in quarts (since there are 4 quarts in a gallon and 128 ounces in a gallon):

Mountain Dew: 6 * 12 = 72 ounces (0.5 quarts)
Fruit juice: 40 ounces (0.25 quarts)
Ginger ale: 5 * 8 = 40 ounces (0.25 quarts)
Orange soda: 2 * 15 = 30 ounces (0.21 quarts)
Ice: 28 ounces (0.19 quarts)

Now, let's add the volumes of all the drinks:

Total volume = 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.21 + 0.19 = 1.4 quarts

Total volume = 1.4 / 4 = 0.35 gallons

Now, let's find out how many 10-ounce servings Carrie has. There are 128 ounces in a gallon, so:

Number of 10-ounce servings = Total volume * (128 ounces / 10 ounces) = 0.35 * 12.8 = 4.48

Since Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats, and we know Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, we can find out how many treats Wanda brings and then calculate the number of treats Jane brings.

Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, so let's call the number of treats Wanda brings T. We know that Jane brings 0.75 * T pieces of bread, so we can write the equation:

90 = 1.5 * T

Solving for T, we get T = 60. So Wanda brings 60 treats.

Now we know that Jane brings 0.75 * 60 = 45 treats.

Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane, so Wanda brings 45 / 2 = 22.5 treats, but since we can't have half a treat, we'll round it down to 22 treats.

Wanda brings 22 treats and 90 - 22 = 68 pieces of bread.

Now we know that Jane brings 45 treats and 0.75 * 45 = 33.75 pieces of bread, but since we can't have a fraction of a piece of bread, we'll round it up to 34 pieces of bread.

Wanda brings 22 treats and 90 - 22 = 68 pieces of bread.
Jane brings 45 treats and 34 pieces of bread.

Now let's find out how many treats and pieces of bread Wanda, Jane, and Carlos bring together:

Wanda brings 22 treats and 90 pieces of bread.
Jane brings 45 treats and 34 pieces of bread.
Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane, so Carlos brings 45 / 3 = 15 treats.
Carlos brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats, so Carlos brings 15 * 2 = 30 pieces of bread.

Now let's find out how many treats and pieces of bread Wanda, Jane, Carlos, and Mia bring together:

Wanda brings 22 treats and 90 pieces of bread.
Jane brings 45 treats and 34 pieces of bread.
Carlos brings 15 treats and 30 pieces of bread.
Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda, so Mia brings 22 - 10 = 12 treats.
Mia brings half as many pieces of bread as treats, so Mia brings 12 / 2 = 6 pieces of bread.

Now we can add up the number of treats and pieces of bread that everyone brought:

Total treats = 22 (Wanda) + 45 (Jane) + 15 (Carlos) + 12 (Mia) = 94 treats
Total pieces of bread = 90 (Wanda) + 34 (Jane) + 30 (Carlos) + 6 (Mia) = 160 pieces of bread

   - Omar: z + 3
   - Priya: 3y - 1

2. We are given the following relationships:
   - Jane visited 6 more than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Han, so x = 2y + 6
   - Han visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude did, so y = 2z - 2
   - Jude visited half as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa did, so z = 6/2 = 3
   - Omar visited 3 more rehabilitation centers than Jude did, so Omar's count is z + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6
   - Priya visited 1 less than three times as many rehabilitation centers as Han did, so 3y - 1 = 3(2y - 2) + 1, which simplifies to y = 4

Harold takes 10 hours more than Emma to run all around the two arenas. what's the total time it takes everyone mentioned to run all around the two arenas?",110.0,"Let's denote the time it takes Emma to run all around the two arenas as E hours.

1. Emma takes E hours, so Fernando takes 2E hours (twice as long).
2. Gina takes half as long as Fernando, so she takes E/2 hours.
3. Harold takes 10 hours more than Emma, so he takes E + 10 hours.

Since they are all running the same course, the total time is the sum of the individual times:

Total time = E (Emma) + 2E (Fernando) + E/2 (Gina) + (E + 10) (Harold)

To simplify the expression, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 4E. Then, we can rewrite the expression as:

Total time = (4E + E) + (8E) + (2E/4) + (E + 10)

Now, we can combine the terms with the same denominator:

Total time = 13E/4 + 10

Since we don't have a specific value for E, we can't provide a numerical answer. However, the final answer is the expression:

1. Apples = 2 * Mangoes (since the total produce of apples was twice that of mangoes)
   Apples = 2 * 400 kg = 800 kg

2. Oranges = Mangoes + 200 kg (since the total produce of oranges was 200 kg more than that of mangoes)
   Oranges = 400 kg + 200 kg = 600 kg

3. Peaches = 0.5 * Oranges (since the total produce of peaches was half the total produce of oranges)
   Peaches = 0.5 * 600 kg = 300 kg

Now, let's find the number of bananas produced:

4. Bananas = Apples - 100 kg (since he produced 100 kg fewer bananas than apples)
   Bananas = 800 kg - 100 kg = 700 kg

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money Mr. Sergio got from selling all the fruits:

5. Total amount of money = (Price per kg of mangoes * Total produce of mangoes) + (Price per kg of apples * Total produce of apples) + (Price per kg of oranges * Total produce of oranges) + (Price per kg of peaches * Total produce of peaches) + (Price per kg of bananas * Total produce of bananas)

Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece.

How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",9.0,"First, let's calculate the amount of lasagna each person will eat, excluding Manny:

1. Aaron will not eat lasagna, so he won't affect the number of pieces.
2. Kai eats twice as much as Manny, so Kai will eat 2 * Manny's pieces.
3. Raphael eats half the amount Manny does, so Raphael will eat 0.5 * Manny's pieces.
4. Lisa eats two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. If Raphael eats 0.5 * Manny's pieces, then Lisa will eat 2 + 0.5 * Manny's pieces - Nora's share.
5. Nora eats one-third of what Manny eats, so Nora will eat 0.33 * Manny's pieces.
6. Lisa eats whatever Nora leaves of her piece, so Lisa will eat (2 + 0.5 * Manny's pieces - 0.33 * Manny's pieces) pieces.
7. Ben eats the same amount of lasagna as Kai, so Ben will eat 2 * Manny's pieces.

Now, we have the total amount of lasagna the other friends will eat:

Total_lasagna_eaten = Kai's + Raphael's + Lisa (with Nora's share) + Ben's
Total_lasagna_eaten = (2 * Manny's pieces) + (0.5 * Manny's pieces) + (2 + 0.5 * Manny's pieces - 0.33 * Manny's pieces) + (2 * Manny's pieces)

Since Manny only wants one piece, the total amount of lasagna the other friends will eat should be equal to the number of pieces Manny should cut his lasagna into minus one.

Manny's_pieces = Total_lasagna_eaten + 1

Now, we can solve for Manny's pieces:

Manny's_pieces = (2 * Manny's pieces) + (0.5 * Manny's pieces) + (2 + 0.5 * Manny's pieces - 0.33 * Manny's pieces) + (2 * Manny's pieces) + 1

If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",77.0,"Let's break this down:

1. The machine has 16 red gumballs.
2. It has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs, so it has 16/2 = 8 blue gumballs.
3. It has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs, so it has 8 yellow gumballs.
4. The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs, so it has 16 - 3 = 13 purple gumballs.
5. For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. So, it has 8 * 4 = 32 green gumballs.

Adding all the gumballs together:

Red + Blue + Yellow + Purple + Green = 16 + 8 + 8 + 13 + 32 = 77 gumballs

So, the final answer is 77.",77,77.0,True,
