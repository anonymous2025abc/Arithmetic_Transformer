On Thursday it rained 1 inches. He can sell water for $1.2 per gallon. How much money did he make from selling all the water?,180.0,"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rainwater collected each day.
2. Sum up the total amount of rainwater collected over the four days.
3. Convert the total amount of rainwater into gallons.
4. Calculate the total revenue from selling the water at $1.2 per gallon.

Let's go through each step in detail.

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rainwater collected each day

- **Monday:** It rained 4 inches.
  \[
  \text{Rainwater collected on Monday} = 4 \text{ inches} \times 15.0 \text{ gallons/inch} = 60 \text{ gallons}
  \]

- **Tuesday:** It rained 3 inches.
  \[
  \text{Rainwater collected on Tuesday} = 3 \text{ inches} \times 15.0 \text{ gallons/inch} = 45 \text{ gallons}
  \]

- **Wednesday:** It rained 2 inches.
  \[
  \text{Rainwater collected on Wednesday} = 2 \text{ inches} \times 15.0 \text{ gallons/inch} = 30 \text{ gallons}
  \]

- **Thursday:** It rained 1 inch.
  \[
  \text{Rainwater collected on Thursday} = 1 \text{ inch} \times 15.0 \text{ gallons/inch} = 15 \text{ gallons}

If her final stage performance is 6 minutes long, what is the total combined amount of time, in minutes, that she spends practicing, throwing tantrums, singing, warm-up and costume changes in the final stage performance?",72.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time spent on each activity (practicing, throwing tantrums, singing, warm-up, and costume changes) based on the given information.

Let's denote the duration of the final stage performance as \( t \) minutes. According to the problem, \( t = 6 \) minutes.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Time Spent Singing:**
   - Carlotta sings for \( t \) minutes.
   - Given \( t = 6 \) minutes, the time spent singing is:
     \[
     \text{Time spent singing} = 6 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Time Spent Practicing:**
   - For every 1 minute of singing, Carlotta spends 3 minutes practicing.
   - Therefore, the time spent practicing is:
     \[
     \text{Time spent practicing} = 3 \times \text{Time spent singing} = 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Time Spent Throwing Tantrums:**
   - For every 1 minute of singing, Carlotta spends 5 minutes throwing tantrums.
   - Therefore, the time spent throwing tantrums is:
     \[
     \text{Time spent throwing tantrums} = 5 \times \text{Time spent singing} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Time Spent Warm-Up:**
   - For every 1 minute of singing, Carlotta spends 1 minute warming up.
   - Therefore, the time spent warming up is:
     \[
     \text{Time spent warming up} = 1 \times \text{Time spent singing} = 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Time Spent Costume Changes:**
   - For every 1 minute of singing, Carlotta spends 2 minutes changing costumes.
   - Therefore, the time spent changing costumes is:
     \[
     \text{Time spent changing costumes} = 2 \times \text{Time spent singing} = 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ minutes}
     \]

### Total Combined Time:

Now, we sum up all the times calculated above:
\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time spent singing} + \text{Time spent practicing} + \text{Time spent throwing tantrums} + \text{Time spent warming up} + \text{Time spent changing costumes}

How many pills does Holly take in a week?",133.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pills Holly takes each day and then multiply that by 7 to find out how many pills she takes in a week.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Insulin Pills:**
   - Holly takes 2 insulin pills per day.

2. **Blood Pressure Pills:**
   - Holly takes 3 blood pressure pills per day.

3. **Anticonvulsant Pills:**
   - Holly takes twice as many anticonvulsant pills as blood pressure pills.
   - Therefore, the number of anticonvulsant pills per day is \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \).

4. **Vitamin C Pills:**
   - Holly takes as many vitamin C pills as insulin pills.
   - Therefore, the number of vitamin C pills per day is 2.

5. **Cholesterol Pills:**
   - Holly takes twice as many cholesterol pills as blood pressure pills.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the number of each type of snack:**
   - Pretzels: 64
   - Goldfish: Four times as many as pretzels = \( 4 \times 64 = 256 \)
   - Suckers: 32
   - Granola bars: 32
   - Cookies: Twice as many as granola bars = \( 2 \times 32 = 64 \)

2. **Sum up all the items:**
   - Total pretzels: 64
   - Total goldfish: 256
   - Total suckers: 32
   - Total granola bars: 32
   - Total cookies: 64

   Adding these together:
   \[
   64 + 256 + 32 + 32 + 64 = 456

There were also 10 less than five times as many purple candies as yellow candies. If Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, how many candies remained?",600.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each type of candy and then calculate the total remaining after Carlos eats all the yellow candies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Red Candies:**
   - Given: \( R = 40 \)

2. **Yellow Candies:**
   - Given: Yellow candies are 20 less than three times as many as red candies.
   - Let \( Y \) be the number of yellow candies.
   - Therefore, \( Y = 3R - 20 \).
   - Substitute \( R = 40 \):
     \[
     Y = 3(40) - 20 = 120 - 20 = 100
     \]

3. **Blue Candies:**
   - Given: Blue candies are half as many as yellow candies.
   - Let \( B \) be the number of blue candies.
   - Therefore, \( B = \frac{Y}{2} \).
   - Substitute \( Y = 100 \):
     \[
     B = \frac{100}{2} = 50
     \]

4. **Green Candies:**
   - Given: Green candies are half as many as red candies.
   - Let \( G \) be the number of green candies.
   - Therefore, \( G = \frac{R}{2} \).
   - Substitute \( R = 40 \):
     \[
     G = \frac{40}{2} = 20
     \]

5. **Purple Candies:**
   - Given: Purple candies are 10 less than five times as many as yellow candies.
   - Let \( P \) be the number of purple candies.
   - Therefore, \( P = 5Y - 10 \).
   - Substitute \( Y = 100 \):
     \[
     P = 5(100) - 10 = 500 - 10 = 490

6. **Total Candies Initially:**
   - Sum up all the candies:
     \[
     \text{Total} = R + Y + B + G + P = 40 + 100 + 50 + 20 + 490 = 700
     \]

7. **Candies Remaining After Carlos Eats All Yellow Candies:**
   - Since Carlos eats all the yellow candies, the number of yellow candies is reduced to zero.
   - Therefore, the total number of candies remaining is:

   \[
   \text{Total Area} = 600 + 1200 + 3000 + 1200 = 6000 \text{ square feet}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of gallons of paint needed:**
   - One gallon of paint covers 600 square feet.
   - To find out how many gallons are needed, divide the total area by the coverage per gallon:
     \[
     \text{Number of Gallons} = \frac{\text{Total Area}}{\text{Coverage per Gallon}}

He leaves a 30% tip on everything he orders. How much did he spend for the night?,199.4,"Let's break down the expenses and calculate them step by step.

### Step 1: Entrance Fee
James pays an entrance fee of $20.

### Step 2: Drinks for Friends
James buys 2 rounds for his 5 friends. Each round consists of 5 drinks.
- Total drinks for friends = 2 rounds * 5 drinks/round = 10 drinks
- Cost per drink = $6
- Total cost for drinks for friends = 10 drinks * $6/drink = $60

### Step 3: Drinks for James
James buys 6 drinks for himself.
- Cost per drink = $6
- Total cost for drinks for James = 6 drinks * $6/drink = $36

### Step 4: Food Expenses
James orders:
- Fried chicken = $14
- 2 nachos = 2 * $8.0 = $16
- 1 wings bucket = $12.0

Total food cost = $14 + $16 + $12.0 = $42

### Step 5: Tip Calculation
He leaves a 30% tip on everything he orders.
- Total ordered amount before tip = Entrance fee + Drinks for friends + Drinks for James + Food
- Total ordered amount before tip = $20 + $60 + $36 + $42 = $158

There were also twice as many zebras as leopards. There were also 3 fewer giraffes than zebras. What is the total number of animals that Josie counted?",830.0,"To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate the number of each type of animal Josie counted.

1. **Antelopes:**
   Josie counted 80 antelopes.

2. **Rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is 34 more than the number of antelopes.
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = 80 + 34 = 114

Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane and three times as many pieces of bread as treats. Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane and twice as many pieces of bread as treats. Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda and half as many pieces of bread as treats. If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",315.0,"Let's break down the information given and solve it step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of treats and pieces of bread each person brings.

#### Jane:
- Let \( T_J \) be the number of treats Jane brings.
- According to the problem, Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats.
- Therefore, the number of pieces of bread Jane brings is \( B_J = 0.75T_J \).

#### Wanda:
- Let \( T_W \) be the number of treats Wanda brings.
- According to the problem, Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane.
- Therefore, \( T_W = \frac{1}{2}T_J \).
- Also, Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats.
- Therefore, the number of pieces of bread Wanda brings is \( B_W = 3T_W = 3 \left(\frac{1}{2}T_J\right) = 1.5T_J \).
- We are given that Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread.
- So, \( 1.5T_J = 90 \).
- Solving for \( T_J \):
  \[
  T_J = \frac{90}{1.5} = 60
  \]
- Now we can find the number of pieces of bread Jane brings:
  \[
  B_J = 0.75 \times 60 = 45
  \]

#### Carlos:
- Let \( T_C \) be the number of treats Carlos brings.
- According to the problem, Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane.
- Therefore, \( T_C = \frac{1}{3}T_J = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \).
- Also, Carlos brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats.
- Therefore, the number of pieces of bread Carlos brings is \( B_C = 2T_C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \).

#### Mia:
- Let \( T_M \) be the number of treats Mia brings.
- According to the problem, Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda.
- Therefore, \( T_M = T_W - 10 = \frac{1}{2}T_J - 10 = 60 - 10 = 50 \).
- Also, Mia brings half as many pieces of bread as treats.
- Therefore, the number of pieces of bread Mia brings is \( B_M = \frac{1}{2}T_M = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \).

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of pieces of bread and treats.

- Total treats:
  \[
  T_{\text{total}} = T_J + T_W + T_C + T_M = 60 + 60 + 20 + 50 = 190
  \]
- Total pieces of bread:
  \[
  B_{\text{total}} = B_J + B_W + B_C + B_M = 45 + 90 + 40 + 25 = 200
  \]

### Step 3: Find the final total number of pieces of bread and treats.

\[
\text{Total} = T_{\text{total}} + B_{\text{total}} = 190 + 200 = 390

If Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers, how many rehabilitation centers did they all visit in total, assuming they are all different?",44.0,"To solve this problem, we will follow the given relationships and substitute the known values step by step.

1. **Lisa's Rehabilitation Centers:**
   - Given: Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers.
   \[
   L = 6
   \]

2. **Jude's Rehabilitation Centers:**
   - Jude visited half as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa.
   \[
   J = \frac{L}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
   \]

3. **Omar's Rehabilitation Centers:**
   - Omar visited 3 more rehabilitation centers than Jude.
   \[
   O = J + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6
   \]

4. **Han's Rehabilitation Centers:**
   - Han visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude.
   \[
   H = 2J - 2 = 2(3) - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4
   \]

5. **Jane's Rehabilitation Centers:**
   - Jane visited 6 more than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Han.
   \[
   Jn = 2H + 6 = 2(4) + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14

6. **Priya's Rehabilitation Centers:**
   - Priya visited 1 less than three times as many rehabilitation centers as Han.
   \[
   P = 3H - 1 = 3(4) - 1 = 12 - 1 = 11
   \]

Now, we sum up the rehabilitation centers visited by each person to find the total number:

\[

If Marcus walks at 6 miles per hour, how much time does he spend with his dog total?",72.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Marcus spends with his dog by breaking down each activity and summing up the times.

1. **Bathing the Dog:**
   Marcus spends 20 minutes giving his dog a bath.

2. **Blow-Drying the Dog:**
   Marcus spends half as long blow-drying his dog as he did bathing it. Therefore, the time spent blow-drying is:
   \[
   \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Brushing the Dog:**
   Marcus spends 8 minutes brushing his dog.

4. **Trimming the Nails:**
   Marcus spends half as long trimming his dog's nails as he did brushing her. Therefore, the time spent trimming the nails is:
   \[
   \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Walking the Dog:**
   Marcus walks his dog along a 3-mile trail at a speed of 6 miles per hour. To find the time taken for the walk, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}

   Converting hours to minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 30 \text{ minutes}

   \text{Oranges} = \text{Mangoes} + 200 = 400 + 200 = 600 \text{ kg}
   \]

4. **Total produce of bananas:**
   Mr. Sergio produced 100 kg fewer bananas than apples.
   \[
   \text{Bananas} = \text{Apples} - 100 = 800 - 100 = 700 \text{ kg}
   \]

5. **Total produce of peaches:**
   The total produce of peaches was half the total produce of oranges.
   \[
   \text{Peaches} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Oranges} = \frac{1}{2} \times 600 = 300 \text{ kg}
   \]

Now, let's sum up all the total produces to find the total weight of all the fruits produced:

\[
\text{Total produce} = \text{Mangoes} + \text{Apples} + \text{Oranges} + \text{Bananas} + \text{Peaches}
\]
\[
\text{Total produce} = 400 + 800 + 600 + 700 + 300 = 2800 \text{ kg}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money Mr. Sergio got from selling these fruits at $50 per kg.

\[
\text{Total revenue} = \text{Total produce} \times \text{Price per kg}
\]
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 2800 \text{ kg} \times 50 \text{ dollars/kg} = 140000 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the total amount of money Mr. Sergio got in that season is:

Safari National park also has twice as many zebras as giraffes. Savanna National park has half as many zebras as lions. Safari National park also has 5 fewer elephants than snakes. Savanna National park has 20 more elephants than Safari National park. How many animals in total does Savanna National park have?",575.0,"Let's break down the information given for Safari National Park:

1. **Lions**: 100
2. **Snakes**: Half as many as lions, so \( \frac{100}{2} = 50 \)
3. **Giraffes**: 10 fewer than snakes, so \( 50 - 10 = 40 \)
4. **Zebras**: Twice as many as giraffes, so \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \)
5. **Elephants**: 5 fewer than snakes, so \( 50 - 5 = 45 \)

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in Safari National Park:
\[
100 \text{ (lions)} + 50 \text{ (snakes)} + 40 \text{ (giraffes)} + 80 \text{ (zebras)} + 45 \text{ (elephants)} = 275

He also buys 4 alpacas that cost 25% less each than a llama. He buys 2 zebras that cost twice as much as a goat each. How much did he spend?,8200.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of animal and then sum these costs.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Goats:**
   - Tim buys 3 goats.
   - Each goat costs $400.
   - Total cost for goats = \( 3 \times 400 = 1200 \) dollars.

2. **Llamas:**
   - Tim buys twice as many llamas as goats, so he buys \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) llamas.
   - Each llama costs 50% more than a goat. Therefore, the cost per llama is \( 400 + (0.5 \times 400) = 400 + 200 = 600 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for llamas = \( 6 \times 600 = 3600 \) dollars.

3. **Alpacas:**
   - Tim buys 4 alpacas.
   - Each alpaca costs 25% less than a llama. Therefore, the cost per alpaca is \( 600 - (0.25 \times 600) = 600 - 150 = 450 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for alpacas = \( 4 \times 450 = 1800 \) dollars.

4. **Zebras:**
   - Tim buys 2 zebras.
   - Each zebra costs twice as much as a goat. Therefore, the cost per zebra is \( 2 \times 400 = 800 \) dollars.
   - Total cost for zebras = \( 2 \times 800 = 1600 \) dollars.

### Summing Up All Costs:
- Total cost for goats = $1200
- Total cost for llamas = $3600
- Total cost for alpacas = $1800
- Total cost for zebras = $1600

Adding these together gives the total amount spent:

1. **Pulsar's Time:**
   - Pulsar stands on his back legs for 10 minutes.
   \[
   \text{Time for Pulsar} = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Polly's Time:**
   - Polly stands on her back legs for three times as long as Pulsar.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the distance traveled with one sail:**
   - Speed with one sail: 25 knots
   - Time with one sail: 4 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance}_\text{one sail} = 25 \text{ knots} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 100 \text{ nautical miles}

2. **Calculate the distance traveled with two sails:**
   - Speed with two sails: 50 knots
   - Time with two sails: 4 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance}_\text{two sails} = 50 \text{ knots} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ nautical miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the distance traveled with three sails:**
   - Speed with three sails: 60 knots
   - Time with three sails: 1 hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance}_\text{three sails} = 60 \text{ knots} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ nautical miles}
   \]

4. **Calculate the distance traveled with four sails:**
   - Speed with four sails: 70 knots
   - Time with four sails: 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance}_\text{four sails} = 70 \text{ knots} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ nautical miles}
   \]

5. **Sum all the distances to get the total distance traveled:**
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_\text{one sail} + \text{Distance}_\text{two sails} + \text{Distance}_\text{three sails} + \text{Distance}_\text{four sails}

How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",9.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much lasagna each person will eat and then sum these amounts to find out how many pieces Manny should cut the lasagna into.

1. **Determine how much each person will eat:**
   - Manny: 1 piece
   - Aaron: 0 pieces (since he won't eat lasagna)
   - Kai: 2 pieces (twice as much as Manny)
   - Raphael: 0.5 pieces (half the amount Manny does)

   - Ben: 2 pieces (same as Kai)

2. **Calculate the total amount of lasagna eaten by Lisa and Raphael:**
   - Raphael eats 0.5 pieces.
   - Lisa eats 2 pieces plus any leftover from Raphael. Since Raphael eats 0.5 pieces, the leftover is \(2 - 0.5 = 1.5\) pieces. Therefore, Lisa eats 2 pieces plus 1.5 pieces, which totals 3.5 pieces.

3. **Calculate the total amount of lasagna eaten by Nora:**
   - Nora eats \(\frac{1}{3}\) of what Manny eats, which is \(\frac{1}{3}\) piece.

His company has 4 sectors with different t-shirt colors. Two sectors use white t-shirts and black t-shirts. He paid $20 for white men's t-shirts and $18 for black men's t-shirts. He paid $22 for blue men's t-shirts. He paid $21 for red men's t-shirts. Each sector has 10 men and 10 women, so there are 80 employees in total. How much did he spend total on buying t-shirts?",1420.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of the t-shirts for both men and women across all sectors and then sum these costs.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the prices of t-shirts:**
   - White men's t-shirts: $20 each
   - Black men's t-shirts: $18 each
   - Blue men's t-shirts: $22 each
   - Red men's t-shirts: $21 each

2. **Determine the price of women's t-shirts:**
   - Women's t-shirts are $5 cheaper than men's t-shirts of the same color.
   - Therefore:
     - White women's t-shirts: $20 - $5 = $15 each
     - Black women's t-shirts: $18 - $5 = $13 each
     - Blue women's t-shirts: $22 - $5 = $17 each
     - Red women's t-shirts: $21 - $5 = $16 each

3. **Calculate the total cost for each sector:**

   **Sector 1 (White Men & Women):**
   - Number of men: 10
   - Number of women: 10
   - Cost for white men's t-shirts: \(10 \times 20 = 200\)
   - Cost for white women's t-shirts: \(10 \times 15 = 150\)
   - Total for Sector 1: \(200 + 150 = 350\)

   **Sector 2 (Black Men & Women):**
   - Number of men: 10
   - Number of women: 10
   - Cost for black men's t-shirts: \(10 \times 18 = 180\)
   - Cost for black women's t-shirts: \(10 \times 13 = 130\)
   - Total for Sector 2: \(180 + 130 = 310\)

   **Sector 3 (Blue Men & Women):**
   - Number of men: 10
   - Number of women: 10
   - Cost for blue men's t-shirts: \(10 \times 22 = 220\)
   - Cost for blue women's t-shirts: \(10 \times 17 = 170\)
   - Total for Sector 3: \(220 + 170 = 390\)

   **Sector 4 (Red Men & Women):**
   - Number of men: 10
   - Number of women: 10
   - Cost for red men's t-shirts: \(10 \times 21 = 210\)
   - Cost for red women's t-shirts: \(10 \times 16 = 160\)
   - Total for Sector 4: \(210 + 160 = 370\)

4. **Sum the totals from all sectors:**
   - Total cost for Sector 1: $350
   - Total cost for Sector 2: $310
   - Total cost for Sector 3: $390
   - Total cost for Sector 4: $370

   Overall total cost: \(350 + 310 + 390 + 370 = 1420\)

How many fish do all the people mentioned have put together?,188.0,"To solve this problem, we will determine the number of fish each person has and then sum them up.

1. **Billy's Fish:**
   Billy has 10 fish.
   \[
   B = 10
   \]

2. **Nina's Fish:**
   Nina has 2 fewer fish than Billy.
   \[
   N = B - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8
   \]

3. **Tony's Fish:**
   Tony has 3 times as many fish as Billy.
   \[
   T = 3B = 3 \times 10 = 30
   \]

4. **Sarah's Fish:**
   Sarah has 5 more fish than Tony.
   \[
   S = T + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35
   \]

5. **Bobby's Fish:**
   Bobby has twice as many fish as Sarah.
   \[
   B = 2S = 2 \times 35 = 70
   \]

6. **Omar's Fish:**
   Omar has half as many fish as Bobby.
   \[
   O = \frac{B}{2} = \frac{70}{2} = 35
   \]

Now, we sum up the total number of fish:

\[
\text{Total} = B + S + T + N + O + \text{Billy's Fish}
\]
\[
\text{Total} = 70 + 35 + 30 + 8 + 35 + 10
\]

Adding these values together:

\[
70 + 35 = 105
\]
\[
105 + 30 = 135
\]
\[
135 + 8 = 143
\]
\[
143 + 35 = 178

Avery has half as many stuffed animals as Kenley. How many stuffed animals do all the people mentioned have in all?,272.0,"To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Determine how many stuffed animals each person has based on the given relationships.
2. Sum up the total number of stuffed animals.

Let's start with McKenna:
- McKenna has 34 stuffed animals.

Next, we calculate how many stuffed animals Kenley has:
- Kenley has twice as many as McKenna.
- Therefore, Kenley has \( 2 \times 34 = 68 \) stuffed animals.

Now, we find out how many stuffed animals Tenly has:
- Tenly has 5 more than Kenley.
- Therefore, Tenly has \( 68 + 5 = 73 \) stuffed animals.

Next, we determine how many stuffed animals Riley has:
- Riley has 10 fewer stuffed animals than Tenly.
- Therefore, Riley has \( 73 - 10 = 63 \) stuffed animals.

Finally, we calculate how many stuffed animals Avery has:
- Avery has half as many stuffed animals as Kenley.
- Therefore, Avery has \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \) stuffed animals.

Now, we sum up the total number of stuffed animals:
- McKenna: 34
- Kenley: 68
- Tenly: 73
- Riley: 63
- Avery: 34

Adding these together:
\[
34 + 68 + 73 + 63 + 34 = 272

What is the total number of legs in his entire collection?,190.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of creature Monroe has and then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Spiders:**
   - Each spider has 8 legs.
   - Monroe has 8 spiders.
   - Total legs from spiders = \( 8 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs/spider} = 64 \text{ legs} \).

2. **Ants:**
   - Each ant has 6 legs.
   - Monroe has 12 ants.
   - Total legs from ants = \( 12 \text{ ants} \times 6 \text{ legs/ant} = 72 \text{ legs} \).

3. **Beetles:**
   - Each beetle has 6 legs.
   - Monroe has 5 beetles.
   - Total legs from beetles = \( 5 \text{ beetles} \times 6 \text{ legs/beetle} = 30 \text{ legs} \).

4. **Scorpions:**
   - Each scorpion has 8 legs.
   - Monroe has 3 scorpions.
   - Total legs from scorpions = \( 3 \text{ scorpions} \times 8 \text{ legs/scorpion} = 24 \text{ legs} \).

### Summing Up All Legs:
Now, we add the total number of legs from each type of creature:
\[
64 \text{ (spiders)} + 72 \text{ (ants)} + 30 \text{ (beetles)} + 24 \text{ (scorpions)} = 190 \text{ legs}

For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs. The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",77.0,"Let's break down the information given and solve it step by step.

1. **Red Gumballs:**
   - Let \( R \) represent the number of red gumballs.
   - According to the problem, \( R = 16 \).

2. **Blue Gumballs:**
   - The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs.
   - Therefore, the number of blue gumballs \( B \) is:
     \[
     B = \frac{R}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
     \]

3. **Green Gumballs:**
   - For each blue gumball, there are 4 times as many green gumballs.
   - Therefore, the number of green gumballs \( G \) is:
     \[
     G = 4B = 4 \times 8 = 32
     \]

4. **Yellow Gumballs:**
   - The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs.
   - Therefore, the number of yellow gumballs \( Y \) is:
     \[
     Y = B = 8
     \]

5. **Purple Gumballs:**
   - The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs.
   - Therefore, the number of purple gumballs \( P \) is:
     \[
     P = R - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13
     \]

Now, we sum up all the gumballs:

\[
\text{Total gumballs} = R + B + G + Y + P = 16 + 8 + 32 + 8 + 13
\]

Adding these together:

\[
16 + 8 = 24
\]
\[
24 + 32 = 56
