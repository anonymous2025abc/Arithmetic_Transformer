How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle and Alice have together if Alice has 20 sheep?",540.0," Let's denote the number of sheep each person has as follows:
- Alice: A
- Seattle: S
- Charleston: C
- Toulouse: T

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. T = 2C (Toulouse has 2 times as many sheep as Charleston)
2. C = 4S (Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle)
3. S = 2A (Seattle has 2 times as many sheep as Alice)
4. A = 20 (Alice has 20 sheep)

Now, let's substitute the values step by step:

From 3, we know S = 2A, so S = 2 * 20 = 40.

From 2, we know C = 4S, so C = 4 * 40 = 160.

From 1, we know T = 2C, so T = 2 * 160 = 320.

Now, let's add up the number of sheep each person has:

Total sheep = T + C + S + A
Total sheep = 320 + 160 + 40 + 20

If Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, how many candies remained?",110.0," First, let's find out how many yellow candies there were. Since there were 20 less than three times as many yellow candies as red candies, we calculate:

Yellow candies = 3 * Red candies - 20
Yellow candies = 3 * 40 - 20
Yellow candies = 120 - 20
Yellow candies = 100

Next, let's find out how many blue candies there were. Since there were half as many blue candies as yellow candies, we calculate:

Blue candies = Yellow candies / 2
Blue candies = 100 / 2

How much did he spend for the night?,183.8," First, let's calculate the cost of the drinks James bought for his friends and himself.

For his friends:
2 rounds for 5 friends means 2 * 5 = 10 drinks.
At $6 each, that's 10 * $6 = $60.

For himself:
6 drinks at $6 each is 6 * $6 = $36.

Now, let's add the cost of the food:
Fried chicken costs $14.
2 nachos at $8 each is 2 * $8 = $16.

The total cost of food is $14 + $16 = $30.

Now, let's calculate the tip. The tip is 30% of the total cost of the drinks and food.

Total cost of drinks and food is $60 (friends' drinks) + $36 (his drinks) + $30 (food) = $126.

The tip is 30% of $126, which is 0.30 * $126 = $37.80.

How long will he spend preparing for and cooking the 5 omelets?",62.0," First, let's calculate the time Bill spends on chopping peppers, onions, and tomatoes:

- Peppers: 4 peppers * 3 minutes/pepper = 12 minutes
- Onions: 2 onions * 4 minutes/onion = 8 minutes
- Tomatoes: 3 tomatoes * 4 minutes/tomato = 12 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time for grating cheese and assembling/cooking the omelets:

- Grating cheese: 5 omelets * 1 minute/omelet = 5 minutes
- Assembling and cooking omelets: 5 omelets * 5 minutes/omelet = 25 minutes

Finally, we add up all the time spent:

12 minutes (peppers) + 8 minutes (onions) + 12 minutes (tomatoes) + 5 minutes (cheese) + 25 minutes (omelets) = 62 minutes

So, Bill will spend a total of 62 minutes preparing for and cooking the 5 omelets.

For Mancino's gardens:
Each garden is 16 feet by 5 feet, so the area of one garden is:
\[ 16 \text{ feet} \times 5 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are 3 gardens, the total area for Mancino's gardens is:
\[ 80 \text{ square feet/garden} \times 3 \text{ gardens} = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

For Marquita's gardens:
Each garden is 8 feet by 4 feet, so the area of one garden is:
\[ 8 \text{ feet} \times 4 \text{ feet} = 32 \text{ square feet} \]
Since there are 2 gardens, the total area for Marquita's gardens is:
\[ 32 \text{ square feet/garden} \times 2 \text{ gardens} = 64 \text{ square feet} \]

For Luis's gardens:

She adds 6 cans of Mountain Dew, each 12 oz, so that's 6 * 12 = 72 oz.
She adds 28 oz of ice.
She adds a 40 oz bottle of fruit juice.
She adds 5 cans of ginger ale, each 8 oz, so that's 5 * 8 = 40 oz.

Now, let's add all these volumes together to get the total volume of the punch:

72 oz (Mountain Dew) + 28 oz (ice) + 40 oz (fruit juice) + 40 oz (ginger ale) = 180 oz.

Now, to find out how many 10 oz servings of punch Carrie has, we divide the total volume of the punch by the volume of one serving:

If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",285.0," Let's denote the number of treats Jane brings as T. According to the problem, Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats, so she brings 0.75T pieces of bread.

Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane, so she brings 0.5T treats. Since Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, she brings 3 * 0.5T = 1.5T pieces of bread. We are told that Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, so:

1.5T = 90

To find T, we divide both sides by 1.5:

T = 90 / 1.5
T = 60

So, Jane brings 60 treats and 0.75 * 60 = 45 pieces of bread.

Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane, so he brings 1/3 * 60 = 20 treats. Since Carlos brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats, he brings 2 * 20 = 40 pieces of bread.

Now, let's add up all the pieces of bread and treats:

Jane's bread: 45
Jane's treats: 60
Wanda's bread: 90
Wanda's treats: 0.5 * 60 = 30

1. Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers.
2. Jude visited half as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa, so Jude visited 6 / 2 = 3 rehabilitation centers.

If Marcus walks at 6 miles per hour, how much time does he spend with his dog total?",68.0," First, let's calculate the time Marcus spends blow-drying his dog. Since it's half as long as the bath, which is 20 minutes, the blow-drying time is:

20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes

Now, let's add up all the time Marcus spends with his dog:

Bath time: 20 minutes
Blow-drying time: 10 minutes
Brushing time: 8 minutes

Total time spent on grooming: 20 + 10 + 8 = 38 minutes

Next, we need to calculate the time Marcus spends walking his dog. The trail is 3 miles long, and he walks at a speed of 6 miles per hour. To find the time, we use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 3 miles / 6 miles per hour = 0.5 hours

To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

0.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes

Now, we add the walking time to the grooming time to find the total time Marcus spends with his dog:

Grooming time: 38 minutes

He is next headed to see the tarantulas. How many tarantulas does he need to see to meet his goal?",126.0," First, let's calculate the total number of legs Borgnine has seen so far.

Chimps have 4 legs each, so 12 chimps have 12 * 4 = 48 legs.
Lions have 4 legs each, so 8 lions have 8 * 4 = 32 legs.
Lizards have 4 legs each, so 5 lizards have 5 * 4 = 20 legs.
Penguins have 2 legs each, so 8 penguins have 8 * 2 = 16 legs.

Now, let's add up all the legs Borgnine has seen:

48 (chimp legs) + 32 (lion legs) + 20 (lizard legs) + 16 (penguin legs) = 116 legs.

Borgnine wants to see a total of 1100 legs. So, the number of legs he still needs to see is:

1100 (total desired legs) - 116 (legs already seen) = 984 legs.

Tarantulas have 8 legs each. To find out how many tarantulas Borgnine needs to see, we divide the remaining number of legs by the number of legs per tarantula:

984 (remaining legs) / 8 (legs per tarantula) = 123 tarantulas.

From the information given, we have:

1. P = R + 3 (The pen is longer than the rubber by 3 centimeters)
2. P = L - 2 (The pen is shorter than the pencil by 2 centimeters)
3. L = 12 centimeters (The pencil is 12 centimeters long)

Using equation 2, we can find the length of the pen:
P = L - 2
P = 12 - 2
P = 10 centimeters

Now, using equation 1, we can find the length of the rubber:
P = R + 3
10 = R + 3
R = 10 - 3
R = 7 centimeters

The marker is 1 centimeter longer than the pencil, so its length is:
Marker = L + 1
Marker = 12 + 1
Marker = 13 centimeters

So, each llama costs $400 + $200 = $600.

Tim gets twice as many llamas as goats, so he buys:

2 * 3 goats = 6 llamas

The total cost for the llamas is:

6 llamas * $600/llama = $3600

Now, let's calculate the cost of each alpaca. Alpacas cost 25% less than llamas, so we find the discount per alpaca:

25% of $600 = 0.25 * $600 = $150

So, each alpaca costs $600 - $150 = $450.

Tim buys 4 alpacas, so the total cost for the alpacas is:

4 alpacas * $450/alpaca = $1800

Finally, we add up the total cost for all the animals:

Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of llamas + Cost of alpacas
Total cost = $1200 + $3600 + $1800
Total cost = $6600

Therefore, Tim spent a total of $6600 on animals for his zoo.

The final answer is: \boxed{6600}",6600,6600.0,True,

In one show, Pulsar stands on his two back legs for a total of 10 minutes. Then, Polly stands on her back legs for three times as long as Pulsar. And then, finally, Petra stands on his back legs for one-sixth as long as Polly. Then, Marvin the mischievous monkey stands on his back legs for half as long as Polly. What is the combined length of time, in minutes, that all the entertainers mentioned stand on their back legs?",60.0," First, let's calculate the time each entertainer stands on their back legs:

1. Pulsar stands on his back legs for 10 minutes.

2. Polly stands on her back legs for three times as long as Pulsar, so:
   Polly's time = 3 * Pulsar's time
   Polly's time = 3 * 10 minutes
   Polly's time = 30 minutes

3. Petra stands on her back legs for one-sixth as long as Polly, so:
   Petra's time = 1/6 * Polly's time
   Petra's time = 1/6 * 30 minutes
   Petra's time = 5 minutes

4. Marvin stands on his back legs for half as long as Polly, so:
   Marvin's time = 1/2 * Polly's time
   Marvin's time = 1/2 * 30 minutes
   Marvin's time = 15 minutes

Now, let's add up the time all the entertainers stand on their back legs:

Total time = Pulsar's time + Polly's time + Petra's time + Marvin's time
Total time = 10 minutes + 30 minutes + 5 minutes + 15 minutes
Total time = 60 minutes

So, the combined length of time that all the entertainers mentioned stand on their back legs is 60 minutes.

Under optimal wind conditions, the use of two sails brings the ship to the speed of 50 knots, whereas under the same conditions, the use of one sail brings her ship to the speed of 25 knots. A knot is a nautical term for speed equal to 1 nautical mile per hour, and one nautical mile equals 1.15 land miles. If she travels in her sailboat under optimal wind conditions for 4 hours with one sail and then for another 4 hours with two sails, Under the same conditions, the use of three sails brings the ship to the speed of 60 knots, and she sails for 1 hour using three sails. what is the total distance, in land miles, that she will travel?",414.0," First, let's calculate the distance Buffy travels with one sail. Since she sails at 25 knots for 4 hours, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance with one sail = Speed × Time
Distance with one sail = 25 knots × 4 hours
Distance with one sail = 100 nautical miles

Now, let's convert this distance to land miles:

Distance in land miles with one sail = 100 nautical miles × 1.15 land miles/nautical mile
Distance in land miles with one sail = 115 land miles

Next, let's calculate the distance she travels with two sails. Since she sails at 50 knots for 4 hours, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance with two sails = Speed × Time
Distance with two sails = 50 knots × 4 hours
Distance with two sails = 200 nautical miles

Now, let's convert this distance to land miles:

Distance in land miles with two sails = 200 nautical miles × 1.15 land miles/nautical mile
Distance in land miles with two sails = 230 land miles

Finally, let's calculate the distance she travels with three sails. Since she sails at 60 knots for 1 hour, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance with three sails = Speed × Time
Distance with three sails = 60 knots × 1 hour
Distance with three sails = 60 nautical miles

Now, let's convert this distance to land miles:

Distance in land miles with three sails = 60 nautical miles × 1.15 land miles/nautical mile
Distance in land miles with three sails = 69 land miles

Now, let's add up all the distances in land miles to get the total distance:

Total distance in land miles = Distance with one sail + Distance with two sails + Distance with three sails
Total distance in land miles = 115 land miles + 230 land miles + 69 land miles
Total distance in land miles = 414 land miles

How much is Peter's remaining money?",402.0," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of each item Peter bought and then subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money he had.

1. Calculate the cost of potatoes:
   - Cost of potatoes = Price per kilo * Quantity
   - Cost of potatoes = $2 * 6 = $12

2. Calculate the cost of tomatoes:
   - Cost of tomatoes = Price per kilo * Quantity
   - Cost of tomatoes = $3 * 9 = $27

3. Calculate the cost of cucumbers:
   - Cost of cucumbers = Price per kilo * Quantity
   - Cost of cucumbers = $4 * 5 = $20

One more friend, Nina, ordered the same as Mell, but she also bought 2 bowls of ice cream. How much money did Mell and her friends need to pay at the cafeteria?",72.0," First, let's calculate the cost of Mell's order:
- 2 cups of coffee: 2 * $4 = $8
- 1 piece of cake: $7

So, Mell's total is $8 + $7 = $15.

Each of Mell's two friends ordered the same as Mell but also bought a bowl of ice cream. So, each friend's total is:
- 2 cups of coffee: 2 * $4 = $8
- 1 piece of cake: $7
- 1 bowl of ice cream: $3

So, each friend's total is $8 + $7 + $3 = $18.

Since there are two friends who ordered the same, their total is 2 * $18 = $36.

Nina ordered the same as Mell but also bought 2 bowls of ice cream. So, Nina's total is:
- 2 cups of coffee: 2 * $4 = $8
- 1 piece of cake: $7
- 2 bowls of ice cream: 2 * $3 = $6

He needs to know how many pieces to cut the lasagna into to serve it. Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Another friend, Nora, is picky and will only eat one-third of what Manny eats, and Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",7.0," Let's calculate the number of pieces each person will eat:

- Manny will eat 1 piece.
- Aaron will not eat any lasagna.
- Kai will eat twice as much as Manny, so Kai will eat 2 pieces.
- Raphael will eat half the amount Manny does, so Raphael will eat 0.5 pieces.
- Lisa will eat 2 pieces, plus whatever Raphael has left of his piece. Since Raphael eats 0.5 pieces, Lisa will eat 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 pieces.
- Nora will eat one-third of what Manny eats, so Nora will eat 1/3 pieces.
- Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. Since Nora eats 1/3 pieces, Lisa will eat 2.5 - 1/3 = 7/3 pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces:

Manny: 1 piece
Kai: 2 pieces
Raphael: 0.5 pieces
Lisa: 7/3 pieces
Nora: 1/3 pieces

Total pieces = 1 + 2 + 0.5 + 7/3 + 1/3
Total pieces = 3.5 + 8/3
Total pieces = 10.5/3 + 8/3
Total pieces = 18.5/3
Total pieces = 6.1666...

Since Manny can't cut the lasagna into a fraction of a piece, he should round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Manny should cut the lasagna into 7 pieces.

How many stuffed animals do all the people mentioned have in all?,238.0," First, let's find out how many stuffed animals Kenley has. Since Kenley has twice as many as McKenna, we multiply McKenna's number of stuffed animals by 2:

Kenley's stuffed animals = 2 * McKenna's stuffed animals
Kenley's stuffed animals = 2 * 34
Kenley's stuffed animals = 68

Next, let's find out how many stuffed animals Tenly has. Tenly has 5 more than Kenley, so we add 5 to Kenley's number of stuffed animals:

Tenly's stuffed animals = Kenley's stuffed animals + 5
Tenly's stuffed animals = 68 + 5
Tenly's stuffed animals = 73

Now, let's find out how many stuffed animals Riley has. Riley has 10 fewer stuffed animals than Tenly, so we subtract 10 from Tenly's number of stuffed animals:

Riley's stuffed animals = Tenly's stuffed animals - 10
Riley's stuffed animals = 73 - 10
Riley's stuffed animals = 63

3. The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs.
4. The machine has 16 red gumballs.

First, let's find out how many blue gumballs there are:
Since the machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs, and there are 16 red gumballs, we can calculate the number of blue gumballs as follows:
Number of blue gumballs = 1/2 * Number of red gumballs
Number of blue gumballs = 1/2 * 16
Number of blue gumballs = 8

Next, let's find out how many green gumballs there are:
For each blue gumball, there are 4 times as many green gumballs. So, we can calculate the number of green gumballs as follows:
