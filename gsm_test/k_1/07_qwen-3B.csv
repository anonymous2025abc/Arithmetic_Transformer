His next 4 customers buy 3 DVDs each. His last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs. How many DVDs did Billy sell on Tuesday?,19.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold by summing up the number of DVDs bought by each group of customers.

1. **First Group (first 3 customers):**
   - Each customer buys 1 DVD.
   - Number of DVDs sold = 3 customers * 1 DVD/customer = 3 DVDs

2. **Second Group (next 2 customers):**
   - Each customer buys 2 DVDs.
   - Number of DVDs sold = 2 customers * 2 DVDs/customer = 4 DVDs

3. **Third Group (next 4 customers):**

He can sell water for $1.2 per gallon. How much money did he make from selling all the water?,162.0,"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rainwater collected each day.
2. Sum up the total amount of rainwater collected over the three days.
3. Convert the total volume of rainwater into gallons.
4. Calculate the total revenue from selling the water at $1.2 per gallon.

Let's go through each step in detail.

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rainwater collected each day

- **Monday:** It rained 4 inches.
  - Rainwater collected = 4 inches * 15.0 gallons/inch = 60 gallons

- **Tuesday:** It rained 3 inches.
  - Rainwater collected = 3 inches * 15.0 gallons/inch = 45 gallons

- **Wednesday:** It rained 2 inches.
  - Rainwater collected = 2 inches * 15.0 gallons/inch = 30 gallons

### Step 2: Sum up the total amount of rainwater collected over the three days

Total rainwater collected = 60 gallons (Monday) + 45 gallons (Tuesday) + 30 gallons (Wednesday)
Total rainwater collected = 135 gallons

### Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the water

He sells water at $1.2 per gallon.

Total revenue = Total rainwater collected * Price per gallon

If her final stage performance is 6 minutes long, what is the total combined amount of time, in minutes, that she spends practicing, throwing tantrums, singing and warm-up in the final stage performance?",60.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time spent on each activity (singing, practicing, throwing tantrums, and warm-up) and then sum these times.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Time Spent Singing:**
   - The final stage performance lasts 6 minutes.
   - Therefore, Carlotta sings for \( 6 \) minutes.

2. **Time Spent Practicing:**
   - For every 1 minute of singing, Carlotta spends an additional 3 minutes practicing.
   - Since she sings for 6 minutes, the time spent practicing is:
     \[
     6 \text{ minutes of singing} \times 3 \text{ minutes of practice per minute of singing} = 18 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Time Spent Throwing Tantrums:**
   - For every 1 minute of singing, Carlotta spends an additional 5 minutes throwing tantrums.
   - Since she sings for 6 minutes, the time spent throwing tantrums is:
     \[
     6 \text{ minutes of singing} \times 5 \text{ minutes of tantrums per minute of singing} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Time Spent Warm-Up:**
   - Carlotta spends 1 minute warming up for each minute of singing.
   - Since she sings for 6 minutes, the time spent warming up is:
     \[
     6 \text{ minutes of singing} \times 1 \text{ minute of warm-up per minute of singing} = 6 \text{ minutes}
     \]

### Total Combined Time:
Now, we sum up all the individual times:
\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time singing} + \text{Time practicing} + \text{Time throwing tantrums} + \text{Time warming up}
\]
\[
\text{Total time} = 6 \text{ minutes} + 18 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} + 6 \text{ minutes}

How many pills does Holly take in a week?",91.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pills Holly takes each day and then multiply that by the number of days in a week (7).

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Insulin Pills:**
   - Holly takes 2 insulin pills per day.

2. **Blood Pressure Pills:**
   - Holly takes 3 blood pressure pills per day.

3. **Anticonvulsant Pills:**
   - Holly takes twice as many anticonvulsant pills as blood pressure pills.
   - Since she takes 3 blood pressure pills per day, she takes \(2 \times 3 = 6\) anticonvulsant pills per day.

4. **Vitamin C Pills:**
   - Holly takes as many vitamin C pills as insulin pills.
   - Since she takes 2 insulin pills per day, she takes 2 vitamin C pills per day.

### Step 1: Calculate the entrance fee
James pays an entrance fee of $20.

#### Entrance Fee
\[
\text{Entrance Fee} = \$20
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of drinks for his friends
James buys 2 rounds for his 5 friends. Each round consists of 5 drinks (one for each friend).

\[
\text{Total Drinks for Friends} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ drinks}

There were also twice as many zebras as leopards. What is the total number of animals that Josie counted?",719.0,"To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate the number of each type of animal Josie counted.

1. **Antelopes:**
   Josie counted 80 antelopes.

2. **Rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is 34 more than the number of antelopes.
   \[
   \text{Number of rabbits} = 80 + 34 = 114

Noah has 7 times as many fish as Micah in his aquarium. How many fish do they have in total?,83.0,"To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Determine how many fish Kenneth has.
2. Determine how many fish Matthias has.
3. Determine how many fish Noah has.
4. Sum up the number of fish each person has to find the total.

Let's start with the given information:

- Micah has 7 fish.
- Kenneth has three times as many fish as Micah.
- Matthias has 15 fewer fish than Kenneth.
- Noah has 7 times as many fish as Micah.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of fish Kenneth has
Kenneth has three times as many fish as Micah. Since Micah has 7 fish:
\[ \text{Kenneth's fish} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of fish Matthias has
Matthias has 15 fewer fish than Kenneth. Since Kenneth has 21 fish:
\[ \text{Matthias's fish} = 21 - 15 = 6 \]

If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",285.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of treats Jane brings:**
   - Let \( T_J \) be the number of treats Jane brings.
   - According to the problem, Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane.
     \[
     T_W = \frac{1}{2} T_J
     \]
   - We know Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, and she brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats.
     \[
     B_W = 3 T_W

   - Substitute \( T_W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
     \[
     90 = 3 \left( \frac{1}{2} T_J \right)
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     90 = \frac{3}{2} T_J
     \]
   - Solve for \( T_J \):
     \[
     T_J = \frac{90 \times 2}{3} = 60

2. **Determine the number of treats Wanda brings:**
   - Since \( T_W = \frac{1}{2} T_J \):
     \[
     T_W = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30

   - Substitute \( T_J \):
     \[
     T_C = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
     \]

4. **Determine the number of pieces of bread Carlos brings:**
   - Let \( B_C \) be the number of pieces of bread Carlos brings.
   - Carlos brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats.
     \[
     B_C = 2 T_C
     \]
   - Substitute \( T_C \):
     \[
     B_C = 2 \times 20 = 40
     \]

5. **Determine the number of pieces of bread Jane brings:**
   - Let \( B_J \) be the number of pieces of bread Jane brings.
   - Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats.
     \[
     B_J = 0.75 T_J

6. **Summarize the total number of pieces of bread and treats:**
   - Total treats:
     \[
     T_{\text{total}} = T_J + T_W + T_C = 60 + 30 + 20 = 110

Then he takes her for a walk along a 3-mile trail. If Marcus walks at 6 miles per hour, how much time does he spend with his dog total?",68.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Marcus spends with his dog by adding up all the individual activities.

1. **Bathing the Dog:**
   Marcus spends 20 minutes giving his dog a bath.

2. **Blow-Drying the Dog:**
   Marcus spends half as long blow-drying his dog as he did bathing it. Therefore, the time spent blow-drying is:
   \[
   \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Brushing the Dog:**
   Marcus spends 8 minutes brushing his dog.

4. **Walking the Dog:**
   Marcus takes his dog for a walk along a 3-mile trail. He walks at a speed of 6 miles per hour. To find the time taken for the walk, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
   \]
   Converting 0.5 hours into minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
   \[
   0.5 \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}

He is next headed to see the tarantulas. How many tarantulas does he need to see to meet his goal?",126.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs Borgnine has already seen and then determine how many more legs he needs to reach his goal of 1100 legs.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of legs for each animal Borgnine has already seen

- **Chimps**: Each chimp has 4 legs.
  \[
  12 \text{ chimps} \times 4 \text{ legs/chimp} = 48 \text{ legs}
  \]

- **Lions**: Each lion has 4 legs.
  \[
  8 \text{ lions} \times 4 \text{ legs/lion} = 32 \text{ legs}
  \]

- **Lizards**: Each lizard has 4 legs.
  \[
  5 \text{ lizards} \times 4 \text{ legs/lizard} = 20 \text{ legs}
  \]

- **Penguins**: Each penguin has 2 legs.
  \[
  8 \text{ penguins} \times 2 \text{ legs/penguin} = 16 \text{ legs}
  \]

### Step 2: Sum up the legs Borgnine has already seen

\[
48 \text{ legs (chimps)} + 32 \text{ legs (lions)} + 20 \text{ legs (lizards)} + 16 \text{ legs (penguins)} = 116 \text{ legs}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the number of legs Borgnine still needs to see to reach his goal

Borgnine's goal is to see 1100 legs. He has already seen 116 legs.

\[
1100 \text{ legs (goal)} - 116 \text{ legs (seen)} = 984 \text{ legs needed}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of tarantulas Borgnine needs to see

Each tarantula has 8 legs.

\[
\frac{984 \text{ legs needed}}{8 \text{ legs/tarantula}} = 123 \text{ tarantulas}

1. **Pencil Length:**
   - The pencil is given to be 12 centimeters long.

2. **Pen Length:**
   - The pen is shorter than the pencil by 2 centimeters.
   - Therefore, the pen's length = Pencil length - 2 cm
   - Pen length = 12 cm - 2 cm = 10 cm

3. **Rubber Length:**
   - The pen is longer than the rubber by 3 centimeters.
   - Therefore, the rubber's length = Pen length - 3 cm
   - Rubber length = 10 cm - 3 cm = 7 cm

4. **Marker Length:**
   - The marker is 1 centimeter longer than the pencil.
   - Therefore, the marker's length = Pencil length + 1 cm
   - Marker length = 12 cm + 1 cm = 13 cm

Now, we need to find the total length of the rubber, the pen, the pencil, and the marker:

- Rubber length = 7 cm
- Pen length = 10 cm
- Pencil length = 12 cm
- Marker length = 13 cm

Adding these lengths together:

\[
\text{Total length} = \text{Rubber length} + \text{Pen length} + \text{Pencil length} + \text{Marker length}

He also buys 4 alpacas that cost 25% less each than a llama. How much did he spend?,6600.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the animals Tim bought. We will break down the costs step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the goats
- Tim buys 3 goats.
- Each goat costs $400.

\[
\text{Total cost of goats} = 3 \times 400 = 1200
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number and cost of the llamas
- Tim gets twice as many llamas as goats.
- Therefore, the number of llamas is \(2 \times 3 = 6\).
- Each llama costs 50% more than a goat. Since each goat costs $400, each llama costs:

\[
400 + (0.5 \times 400) = 400 + 200 = 600
\]

\[
\text{Total cost of llamas} = 6 \times 600 = 3600
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the alpacas
- Tim buys 4 alpacas.
- Each alpaca costs 25% less than a llama. Since each llama costs $600, each alpaca costs:

\[
600 - (0.25 \times 600) = 600 - 150 = 450
\]

\[
\text{Total cost of alpacas} = 4 \times 450 = 1800
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total amount spent
Now, we sum up the costs of all the animals:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of goats} + \text{Cost of llamas} + \text{Cost of alpacas}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 1200 + 3600 + 1800 = 6600

What is the combined length of time, in minutes, that all the entertainers mentioned stand on their back legs?",60.0,"To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate the time each entertainer stands on their back legs.

1. **Time Pulsar stands on his back legs:**
   \[
   \text{Pulsar's time} = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Time Polly stands on her back legs:**
   Polly stands on her back legs for three times as long as Pulsar.
   \[
   \text{Polly's time} = 3 \times \text{Pulsar's time} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Time Petra stands on her back legs:**
   Petra stands on her back legs for one-sixth as long as Polly.
   \[
   \text{Petra's time} = \frac{1}{6} \times \text{Polly's time} = \frac{1}{6} \times 30 = 5 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Time Marvin the monkey stands on his back legs:**
   Marvin stands on his back legs for half as long as Polly.
   \[
   \text{Marvin's time} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Polly's time} = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ minutes}

Under optimal wind conditions, the use of two sails brings the ship to the speed of 50 knots, whereas under the same conditions, the use of one sail brings her ship to the speed of 25 knots. A knot is a nautical term for speed equal to 1 nautical mile per hour, and one nautical mile equals 1.15 land miles. If she travels in her sailboat under optimal wind conditions for 4 hours with one sail and then for another 4 hours with two sails, Under the same conditions, the use of three sails brings the ship to the speed of 60 knots, and she sails for 1 hour using three sails. what is the total distance, in land miles, that she will travel?",414.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Buffy travels under different sail configurations and then convert that distance into land miles.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the distance traveled with one sail:**
   - Speed with one sail = 25 knots
   - Time with one sail = 4 hours

   Distance with one sail = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance with one sail} = 25 \text{ knots} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 100 \text{ nautical miles}
   \]

2. **Convert the distance from nautical miles to land miles:**
   - 1 nautical mile = 1.15 land miles
   \[
   \text{Distance with one sail in land miles} = 100 \text{ nautical miles} \times 1.15 \text{ land miles/nautical mile} = 115 \text{ land miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the distance traveled with two sails:**
   - Speed with two sails = 50 knots
   - Time with two sails = 4 hours

   Distance with two sails = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance with two sails} = 50 \text{ knots} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ nautical miles}
   \]

4. **Convert the distance from nautical miles to land miles:**
   \[
   \text{Distance with two sails in land miles} = 200 \text{ nautical miles} \times 1.15 \text{ land miles/nautical mile} = 230 \text{ land miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the distance traveled with three sails:**
   - Speed with three sails = 60 knots
   - Time with three sails = 1 hour

   Distance with three sails = Speed × Time
   \[
   \text{Distance with three sails} = 60 \text{ knots} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ nautical miles}
   \]

6. **Convert the distance from nautical miles to land miles:**
   \[
   \text{Distance with three sails in land miles} = 60 \text{ nautical miles} \times 1.15 \text{ land miles/nautical mile} = 69 \text{ land miles}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance with one sail} + \text{Distance with two sails} + \text{Distance with three sails}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 115 \text{ land miles} + 230 \text{ land miles} + 69 \text{ land miles} = 414 \text{ land miles}

Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Another friend, Nora, is picky and will only eat one-third of what Manny eats, and Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",7.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine how much each person will eat:**
   - Manny: 1 piece
   - Aaron: 0 pieces (since he won't eat lasagna)
   - Kai: 2 pieces (twice as much as Manny)
   - Raphael: 0.5 pieces (half of Manny's portion)
   - Lisa: 2 pieces + Raphael's remaining piece (Raphael's piece = 0.5 pieces, so Lisa will eat 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 pieces)
   - Nora: \(\frac{1}{3}\) of Manny's portion = \(\frac{1}{3}\) piece
   - Lisa: Whatever is left after Nora eats, which is \(2.5 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{7.5}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{6.5}{3} = \frac{13}{6}\) pieces

2. **Sum up all the portions to find out how many pieces the lasagna should be cut into:**
   - Manny: 1 piece
   - Aaron: 0 pieces
   - Kai: 2 pieces
   - Raphael: 0.5 pieces
   - Lisa: 2.5 pieces
   - Nora: \(\frac{1}{3}\) piece
   - Lisa: \(\frac{13}{6}\) pieces

   Total pieces = \(1 + 0 + 2 + 0.5 + 2.5 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{13}{6}\)

3. **Convert all fractions to have a common denominator (6) for easier addition:**
   - \(1 = \frac{6}{6}\)
   - \(0 = 0\)
   - \(2 = \frac{12}{6}\)
   - \(0.5 = \frac{3}{6}\)
   - \(2.5 = \frac{15}{6}\)
   - \(\frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{6}\)
   - \(\frac{13}{6} = \frac{13}{6}\)

4. **Add these fractions together:**
   \[
   \frac{6}{6} + 0 + \frac{12}{6} + \frac{3}{6} + \frac{15}{6} + \frac{2}{6} + \frac{13}{6}

   = \frac{6 + 0 + 12 + 3 + 15 + 2 + 13}{6}

If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",64.0,"To solve this problem, we will follow the given relationships between the different colored gumballs and use the information provided to find the total number of gumballs.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Red Gumballs:**
   - Given that the machine has 16 red gumballs.
   - Let \( R = 16 \).

2. **Blue Gumballs:**
   - The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs.
   - Therefore, the number of blue gumballs \( B \) is:
     \[
     B = \frac{R}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
     \]

3. **Green Gumballs:**
   - For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs.
   - Therefore, the number of green gumballs \( G \) is:
     \[
     G = 4B = 4 \times 8 = 32
     \]

4. **Yellow Gumballs:**
   - The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs.
   - Therefore, the number of yellow gumballs \( Y \) is:
     \[
     Y = B = 8
     \]

5. **Total Number of Gumballs:**
   - To find the total number of gumballs, we sum up all the gumballs of each color:
     \[
     \text{Total} = R + B + G + Y = 16 + 8 + 32 + 8
     \]
   - Adding these together:
     \[
     \text{Total} = 16 + 8 + 32 + 8 = 64
     \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{64}
