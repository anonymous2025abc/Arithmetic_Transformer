For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",64.0,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Blue gumballs:** The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs, so there are 16 red gumballs / 2 = 8 blue gumballs.

2. **Green gumballs:** For each blue gumball, there are 4 times as many green gumballs, so there are 8 blue gumballs * 4 = 32 green gumballs.

3. **Yellow gumballs:** The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs, so there are 8 yellow gumballs.
