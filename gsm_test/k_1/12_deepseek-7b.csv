The living room walls take up 600 square feet.

The bedroom walls take up 400 square feet each, and there are 3 of them, so the total square footage of the bedroom walls is 400 * 3 = 1200 square feet.

Adding up the square footage of all the walls, we get 600 (living room) + 1200 (bedrooms) + 3000 (kitchen) = 4800 square feet.

Since one gallon of paint covers 600 square feet, we divide the total square footage by the coverage of one gallon to find out how many gallons of paint Henrietta needs.

Next, let's calculate the time Bill spends on chopping onions. It takes him 4 minutes to chop an onion, and he needs to chop 2 onions. So, he spends 4 minutes/onion * 2 onions = 8 minutes on chopping onions.

Then, let's calculate the time Bill spends on grating cheese. It takes him 1 minute to grate enough cheese for one omelet, and he needs to grate cheese for cooking each of 5 omelets. So, he spends 1 minute/omelet * 5 omelets = 5 minutes on grating cheese.

If Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers, how many rehabilitation centers did they all visit in total, assuming they are all different?",33.0," Let's denote the number of rehabilitation centers visited by each person as follows:

- Lisa = L
- Jude = J
- Han = H
- Jane = Ja
- Omar = O

From the problem, we know that:

- Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers, so L = 6.
- Jude visited half as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa did, so J = L/2 = 6/2 = 3.
- Han visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude did, so H = 2*J - 2 = 2*3 - 2 = 4.
- Jane visited 6 more than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Han did, so Ja = 2*H + 6 = 2*4 + 6 = 14.
- Omar visited 3 more rehabilitation centers than Jude did, so O = J + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6.

Now, we can add up the number of rehabilitation centers visited by each person to find the total:

Total = L + J + H + Ja + O = 6 + 3 + 4 + 14 + 6 = 33.

Second, Nina has 2 fewer fish in her aquarium than Billy does. So, Nina has 10 - 2 = 8 fish.

Third, Tony has 3 times as many fish in his aquarium as Billy does. So, Tony has 3 * 10 = 30 fish.

Fourth, Sarah has 5 more fish in her aquarium than Tony does. So, Sarah has 30 + 5 = 35 fish.

Fifth, Bobby has an aquarium with twice as many fish as Sarah's has. So, Bobby has 2 * 35 = 70 fish.

Finally, to find out how many fish all the people mentioned have put together, we add up the number of fish each person has. So, the total number of fish is 10 (Billy's) + 8 (Nina's) + 30 (Tony's) + 35 (Sarah's) + 70 (Bobby's) = 153 fish.

So the answer is $\boxed{153}$.",153,153.0,True,

Riley has 10 fewer stuffed animals than Tenly. How many stuffed animals do all the people mentioned have in all?,238.0," McKenna has 34 stuffed animals.
Kenley has twice as many as McKenna, so Kenley has 2 * 34 = 68 stuffed animals.
Tenly has 5 more than Kenley, so Tenly has 68 + 5 = 73 stuffed animals.
Riley has 10 fewer stuffed animals than Tenly, so Riley has 73 - 10 = 63 stuffed animals.
In total, all the people mentioned have 34 + 68 + 73 + 63 = 238 stuffed animals.

Her friends are Jessica, Tori, Lily, Patrice, and Ava. If each jelly bracelet costs $2, what is the total she will spend in dollars?",50.0," First, we need to find out how many letters are in each friend's name.

Jessica has 7 letters.
Tori has 4 letters.
Lily has 4 letters.
Patrice has 7 letters.
Ava has 3 letters.

So, Robin needs to buy 7 + 4 + 4 + 7 + 3 = 25 jelly bracelets.

Since each jelly bracelet costs $2, Robin will spend 25 * $2 = $50.

So the answer is $\boxed{50}$.",50,50.0,True,

What is the total number of legs in his entire collection?,166.0," Each spider has 8 legs, so 8 spiders have 8 * 8 = 64 legs.
Each ant has 6 legs, so 12 ants have 12 * 6 = 72 legs.
Each beetle has 6 legs, so 5 beetles have 5 * 6 = 30 legs.

For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",64.0," Let's denote the number of red gumballs as R, the number of blue gumballs as B, the number of green gumballs as G, and the number of yellow gumballs as Y.

From the problem, we know that:

1. R = 16 (the machine has 16 red gumballs)
2. B = R/2 (the machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs)
3. G = 4B (the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs for each blue gumball)
4. Y = B (the machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs)

Now, let's substitute the values into the equations:

1. B = 16/2 = 8 (the machine has 8 blue gumballs)
2. G = 4*8 = 32 (the machine has 32 green gumballs)
3. Y = 8 (the machine has 8 yellow gumballs)

The total number of gumballs in the machine is the sum of the red, blue, green, and yellow gumballs, which is R + B + G + Y = 16 + 8 + 32 + 8 = 64.

So the answer is $\boxed{64}$.",64,64.0,True,
