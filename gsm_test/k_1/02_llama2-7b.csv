If Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, how many candies remained?",110.0," To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the problem to find the number of each color of candy remaining after Carlos ate all the yellow candies.

Let's start by using the information that there are 40 red candies, 20 less than three times as many yellow candies as red candies. This means that there are 3 times as many yellow candies as red candies, or 40 x 3 = 120 yellow candies.

Since Carlos ate all the yellow candies, there are now 120 - 10 = 110 yellow candies remaining.

Next, we are told that there are half as many blue candies as yellow candies. This means that there are 110 / 2 = 55 blue candies remaining.

The volume of the punch is equal to the volume of the Mountain Dew cans plus the volume of the ice plus the volume of the fruit juice plus the volume of the ginger ale cans.

The volume of a 12-oz can of Mountain Dew is 12 oz. Since Carrie added 6 cans, the total volume of the Mountain Dew is:

The volume of ice is 28 oz.

The volume of the fruit juice is 40 oz.

The volume of the ginger ale cans is 8 oz each, so the total volume of the ginger ale is:

5 x 8 oz = 40 oz

Therefore, the total volume of the punch is:

72 oz + 28 oz + 40 oz + 40 oz = 190 oz

To convert the volume of the punch to 10 oz servings, we divide the total volume by 10:

Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane and three times as many pieces of bread as treats. Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane and twice as many pieces of bread as treats. If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",285.0," To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the problem to find the number of pieces of bread and treats brought by each person, and then add them up to find the total number.

Let's start by using the information given about Jane:

* Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats to the zoo.
* Jane brings 90 pieces of bread.

So, if Jane brings 75% of the number of treats, that means she brings 75% of 90 = 67.5 pieces of bread.

Now, let's find out how many treats Jane brings:

* Jane brings 75% as many treats as she brings pieces of bread.
* 75% of 67.5 = 50.625 treats (round up to 51 treats)

Now, let's find out how many pieces of bread Wanda brings:

* Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane.
* 51 treats / 2 = 25.5 treats

And how many pieces of bread Wanda brings:

* Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats.
* 25.5 treats x 3 = 76.5 pieces of bread

Now, let's find out how many pieces of bread Carlos brings:

* Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane.
* 51 treats / 3 = 17 treats

And how many pieces of bread Carlos brings:

* Carlos brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats.
* 17 treats x 2 = 34 pieces of bread

Now, let's add up the total number of pieces of bread and treats brought by everyone:

* Jane brings 67.5 pieces of bread and 51 treats.
* Wanda brings 76.5 pieces of bread and 25.5 treats.
* Carlos brings 34 pieces of bread and 17 treats.

Total number of pieces of bread and treats = 67.5 + 76.5 + 34 = 188 pieces of bread and 152 treats.

Therefore, the final answer is: #### 188 <number>

Han visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude did. Jude visited half as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa did. Omar visited 3 more rehabilitation centers than Jude did. If Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers, how many rehabilitation centers did they all visit in total, assuming they are all different?",33.0," Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Jane visited 6 more than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Han. So, if Han visited x rehabilitation centers, Jane visited 6 + 2x centers.
2. Han visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude did. So, if Jude visited y rehabilitation centers, Han visited 2y - 2 centers.
3. Jude visited half as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa did. So, if Lisa visited z rehabilitation centers, Jude visited z/2 centers.
4. Omar visited 3 more rehabilitation centers than Jude did. So, if Jude visited z centers, Omar visited 3 + z centers.

Now, let's find the total number of rehabilitation centers visited by all of them:

Jane visited 6 + 2x centers, Han visited 2y - 2 centers, Jude visited z/2 centers, and Omar visited 3 + z centers.

We can simplify the equation by combining the like terms:

Jane + Han + Jude + Omar = 6 + 2x + z/2 + 3 + z

Now, we can solve for x, y, z, and x by substituting the values given in the problem:

6 + 2(6) + z/2 + 3 + z = 24

Simplifying the equation, we get:

6 + 12 + z/2 + 3 + z = 24

Solving for z, we get:

z = 16

So, the total number of rehabilitation centers visited by all of them is:

6 + 2(6) + z/2 + 3 + z = 6 + 12 + 8 + 3 + 16 = 44

He is next headed to see the tarantulas. How many tarantulas does he need to see to meet his goal?",126.0," To determine how many tarantulas Borgnine needs to see to meet his goal of 1100 legs at the zoo, we can use the information provided:

* Borgnine has already seen 12 chimps, 8 lions, and 5 lizards.
* He saw 8 penguins.
* He is next headed to see the tarantulas.

We can calculate the total number of legs Borgnine has seen so far:

12 chimps x 4 legs/chimp = 48 legs
8 lions x 4 legs/lion = 32 legs
5 lizards x 4 legs/lizard = 20 legs
8 penguins x 2 legs/penguin = 16 legs

Total legs seen so far = 48 + 32 + 20 + 16 = 110 legs

To determine how many tarantulas Borgnine needs to see to meet his goal, we can subtract the total legs he has seen so far from his goal:

Considering the pencil is 12 centimeters long, A marker is 1 centimeter longer than the pencil. what is the total length of the rubber, the pen, the pencil, and all the other stationery items mentioned altogether?",42.0," To solve this problem, we need to find the length of each item and then add them up.

1. The rubber is 3 centimeters longer than the pencil, so the length of the rubber is:

Rubber length = Pencil length + 3 cm = 12 cm + 3 cm = 15 cm

2. The pen is longer than the rubber by 3 centimeters, so the length of the pen is:

Pen length = Rubber length - 3 cm = 15 cm - 3 cm = 12 cm

3. The pencil is 12 centimeters long, so the length of the pencil is:

Pencil length = 12 cm

4. The marker is 1 centimeter longer than the pencil, so the length of the marker is:

Marker length = Pencil length + 1 cm = 12 cm + 1 cm = 13 cm

Now, let's add up the length of all the stationery items:

Total length = Rubber length + Pen length + Pencil length + Marker length

They also have a younger brother named Liam who is 1 year younger than the youngest of the three oldest brothers. How old is the youngest brother?,30.0," To solve this problem, we can use the information given to us:

* The ages of the three oldest brothers are consecutive integers.
* The sum of their ages is 96.
* The younger brother Liam is 1 year younger than the youngest of the three oldest brothers.

Let the ages of the three oldest brothers be x, x+1, and x+2, where x is the youngest.

We know that the sum of their ages is 96, so we can write:

x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 96

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x + 3 = 96

Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get:

3x = 93

1. Under optimal wind conditions, the use of two sails brings the ship to the speed of 50 knots.
2. Under the same conditions, the use of one sail brings the ship to the speed of 25 knots.
3. If she travels for 4 hours with one sail and then for another 4 hours with two sails, she will travel a total distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 25 knots x 4 hours
= 100 nautical miles

4. If she uses three sails, the speed of the ship will be:

Speed = 60 knots

and she will travel for 1 hour:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 60 knots x 1 hour
= 60 nautical miles

Now, we need to convert the distances from nautical miles to land miles. There are 1.15 land miles in a nautical mile, so:

Land miles = Nautical miles x 1.15

For the distance traveled with one sail:

Land miles = 100 nautical miles x 1.15

For the distance traveled with two sails:

Land miles = 60 nautical miles x 1.15

Total cost = $12 + $27 + $20 + $15 + $24 = $108

Remaining money = $500 - $108 = $392

Therefore, Peter's remaining money is $392.

Two of her friends ordered the same, but each of them also bought a bowl of ice cream. One cup of coffee is $4, one piece of cake is $7, and a bowl of ice cream is $3. One more friend, Nina, ordered the same as Mell, but she also bought 2 bowls of ice cream. How much money did Mell and her friends need to pay at the cafeteria?",72.0," To find out how much money Mell and her friends needed to pay at the cafeteria, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items they ordered.

Mell ordered:

* 2 cups of coffee = $8
* 1 piece of cake = $7

Total cost of Mell's order = $8 + $7 = $15

Her 2 friends ordered:

* 2 cups of coffee = $8 x 2 = $16
* 1 piece of cake = $7
* 2 bowls of ice cream = $3 x 2 = $6

Total cost of first friend's order = $16 + $7 + $6 = $39

Total cost of second friend's order = $16 + $7 + $6 = $39

Nina ordered:

* 2 cups of coffee = $8 x 2 = $16
* 1 piece of cake = $7
* 2 bowls of ice cream = $3 x 2 = $6

Total cost of Nina's order = $16 + $7 + $6 = $39

Therefore, the total amount of money Mell and her friends needed to pay at the cafeteria is:

$15 + $39 + $39 = $113

2,llama2-7b,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,1,44,43,"Manny is making lasagna for dinner with his four friends, Lisa, Raphael, Aaron, and Kai. He needs to know how many pieces to cut the lasagna into to serve it. Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Another friend, Nora, is picky and will only eat one-third of what Manny eats, and Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",7.0," To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much lasagna each person will eat, taking into account their individual preferences and the number of pieces Manny wants to cut.

1. Aaron: Aaron doesn't like lasagna, so he will only eat garlic bread and salad. Let's assume he eats 1/4 of the lasagna (since he won't eat any).
2. Kai: Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. So, Kai will eat 2 x 2 = 4 pieces of lasagna.
3. Raphael: Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does. So, if Manny eats 1 piece, Raphael will eat 1/2 = 0.5 pieces.
4. Lisa: Lisa loves lasagna and will eat 2 pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. So, Lisa will eat 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 pieces.
5. Nora: Nora is picky and will only eat one-third of what Manny eats. So, if Manny eats 1 piece, Nora will eat 1/3 = 0.33 pieces.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pieces of lasagna that Manny should cut:

Manny: 1 piece
Aaron: 0 pieces (since Aaron doesn't eat lasagna)
Kai: 4 pieces
Raphael: 0.5 pieces
Lisa: 2.5 pieces
Nora: 0.33 pieces

Total number of pieces: 1 + 0 + 4 + 0.5 + 2.5 + 0.33 = 8.33 pieces

So, Manny should cut his lasagna into 8 pieces. Since we can't have a fraction of a piece, we will round up to 9 pieces. Therefore, the final answer is: #### <9>",<9>,9.0,False,

He paid $22 for blue men's t-shirts. Each sector has 10 men and 10 women, so there are 60 employees in total. How much did he spend total on buying t-shirts?",1050.0," To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the problem to find the cost of each type of t-shirt and then add up the total cost.

Let's start by finding the cost of each type of t-shirt:

* White men's t-shirts: $20 x 10 men = $200
* White women's t-shirts: $5 cheaper than white men's t-shirts, so $200 - $5 = $195
* Black men's t-shirts: $18 x 10 men = $180
* Black women's t-shirts: $5 cheaper than black men's t-shirts, so $180 - $5 = $175
* Blue men's t-shirts: $22 x 10 men = $220

Now, let's find the total cost of buying t-shirts for all 60 employees:

Total cost of white men's t-shirts = 10 men x $200 = $2,000
Total cost of white women's t-shirts = 10 women x $195 = $1,950
Total cost of black men's t-shirts = 10 men x $180 = $1,800
Total cost of black women's t-shirts = 10 women x $175 = $1,750
Total cost of blue men's t-shirts = 10 men x $220 = $2,200

Total cost of buying t-shirts for all 60 employees = $2,000 + $1,950 + $1,800 + $1,750 + $2,200 = $9,800

Tony has 3 times as many fish in his aquarium as Billy does. Billy has 10 fish. Nina has 2 fewer fish in her aquarium than Billy does. How many fish do all the people mentioned have put together?,153.0," Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Bobby has twice as many fish as Sarah's aquarium, so Bobby has 2x = 2(5) = 10 fish.
2. Sarah has 5 more fish than Tony, so Sarah has 5 + 3 = 8 fish.
3. Tony has 3 times as many fish as Billy, so Tony has 3x = 3(10) = 30 fish.
4. Billy has 10 fish, so Billy has 10 fish.
5. Nina has 2 fewer fish than Billy, so Nina has 10 - 2 = 8 fish.

Now, let's add up the number of fish each person has:

Bobby has 10 fish
Sarah has 8 + 5 = 13 fish
Tony has 30 fish
Billy has 10 fish
Nina has 8 fish

So, the total number of fish all the people mentioned have is:

10 + 13 + 30 + 10 + 8 = 71 fish.

How many stuffed animals do all the people mentioned have in all?,238.0," To solve this problem, we need to find the number of stuffed animals each person has and then add them up to find the total number of stuffed animals among all the people mentioned.

Let's start by finding out how many stuffed animals McKenna has:

McKenna has 34 stuffed animals.

Next, let's find out how many stuffed animals Kenley has:

Kenley has twice as many stuffed animals as McKenna, so Kenley has 2 x 34 = 68 stuffed animals.

Now, let's find out how many stuffed animals Tenly has:

Tenly has 5 more stuffed animals than Kenley, so Tenly has 68 + 5 = 73 stuffed animals.

Finally, let's find out how many stuffed animals Riley has:

Riley has 10 fewer stuffed animals than Tenly, so Riley has 73 - 10 = 63 stuffed animals.

Her friends are Jessica, Tori, Lily, Patrice, and Ava. If each jelly bracelet costs $2, what is the total she will spend in dollars?",50.0," To find the total cost that Robin will spend on jelly bracelets, we need to multiply the number of bracelets she wants to buy by the cost of each bracelet.

Since Robin wants to buy one bracelet for each letter of her friends' first names, we can use the number of letters in each name to determine how many bracelets she needs to buy. Here are the letters in each of Robin's friends' first names:

* Jessica: 7 letters
* Tori: 5 letters
* Lily: 5 letters
* Patrice: 9 letters
* Ava: 4 letters

So, the total number of bracelets Robin needs to buy is:

7 + 5 + 5 + 9 + 4 = 30

Since each bracelet costs $2, the total cost that Robin will spend on jelly bracelets is:

30 x $2 = $60

What is the total number of legs in his entire collection?,166.0," To find the total number of legs in Monroe's entire collection, we need to count the number of legs for each type of creature and add them up.

Ants have 6 legs each, so the total number of legs for the 12 ants is:

12 ants x 6 legs per ant = 72 legs

Spiders have 8 legs each, so the total number of legs for the 8 spiders is:

8 spiders x 8 legs per spider = 64 legs

Beetles have 6 legs each, so the total number of legs for the 5 beetles is:

5 beetles x 6 legs per beetle = 30 legs

Adding up the number of legs for each type of creature, we get:

72 legs + 64 legs + 30 legs = 166 legs

Therefore, the total number of legs in Monroe's entire collection is 166 legs.

For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",64.0," To solve this problem, we can use the information given in the problem to create a ratio of the number of gumballs of each color in the machine.

Let's start by using the fact that the machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs. This means that if the machine has $x$ red gumballs, it has $x/2$ blue gumballs.

Next, we know that for each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. This means that if the machine has $x$ blue gumballs, it has $4x$ green gumballs.

Finally, we know that the machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs. This means that if the machine has $x$ blue gumballs, it has $x$ yellow gumballs.

Now, we can use these ratios to find the total number of gumballs in the machine. We can do this by multiplying the number of red gumballs by the ratio of red to blue gumballs, and then multiplying the result by the ratio of blue to green gumballs, and so on.

Here's the calculation:

Number of red gumballs = 16

Ratio of red to blue gumballs = 16/2 = 8

Number of blue gumballs = 16 x 8 = 128

Ratio of blue to green gumballs = 128/4 = 32

Number of green gumballs = 128 x 32 = 4096

Ratio of green to yellow gumballs = 4096/1 = 4096

Number of yellow gumballs = 4096

Therefore, the total number of gumballs in the machine is:

Red gumballs = 16
Blue gumballs = 128
Green gumballs = 4096
Yellow gumballs = 4096

Total number of gumballs = Red + Blue + Green + Yellow = 16 + 128 + 4096 + 4096 = 4630

So, there are 4630 gumballs in the machine.
