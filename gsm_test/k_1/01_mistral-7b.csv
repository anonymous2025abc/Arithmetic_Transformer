How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle and Alice have together if Alice has 20 sheep?",540.0,"First, let's find out the relationship between the number of sheep in each city based on the given information:

1. Toulouse has 2 times as many sheep as Charleston.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
3. Seattle has 2 times as many sheep as Alice.

Let's use variables to represent the number of sheep in each city:
- T: Number of sheep in Toulouse
- C: Number of sheep in Charleston
- S: Number of sheep in Seattle
- A: Number of sheep in Alice (given as 20)

From the information, we can create the following equations:

1. T = 2 * C
2. C = 4 * S
3. S = 2 * A

Now, we can substitute the equation for S into the equation for C:

C = 4 * (2 * A)

Next, we can substitute the equation for C into the equation for T:

T = 2 * (4 * (2 * A))

Now, we can substitute the given value for A:

T = 2 * (4 * (2 * 20))

Now, we can solve for T:

T = 2 * (4 * 40)
T = 2 * 160
T = 320

Now, we can find the number of sheep in Charleston by using the equation for C:

C = 4 * S
C = 4 * (2 * A)
C = 4 * (2 * 20)
C = 4 * 40
C = 160

Now, we can find the number of sheep in Seattle by using the equation for S:

S = 2 * A
S = 2 * 20
S = 40

Now, we can find the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle, and Alice:

Total sheep = T + C + S + A
Total sheep = 320 + 160 + 40 + 20
Total sheep = 520

So, Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle, and Alice have a total of 520 sheep.",520,520.0,False,

If Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, how many candies remained?",110.0,"Let's break this down:

1. Maria had 40 red candies.
2. There were three times as many yellow candies as red candies, so there were 3 * 40 = 120 yellow candies.
3. There were half as many blue candies as yellow candies, so there were 120 / 2 = 60 blue candies.
4. There were half as many green candies as red candies, so there were 40 / 2 = 20 green candies.

Now, since Carlos ate all the yellow candies, we need to find out how many candies remain:

1. Red candies: 40
2. Blue candies: 60
3. Green candies: 20
4. Yellow candies (eaten by Carlos): 120

So, the total number of candies before Carlos ate the yellow ones was 40 (red) + 60 (blue) + 20 (green) = 120 candies.

After Carlos ate the yellow candies, there are no yellow candies left, but the remaining candies are still the same: 40 (red) + 0 (eaten yellow) + 60 (blue) + 20 (green) = 120 - 120 (eaten yellow) = 0 candies left.

However, this answer doesn't make sense because there should be some candies left after Carlos ate the yellow ones. Let's recheck the problem:

1. Maria had 40 red candies.
2. There were three times as many yellow candies as red candies, so there were 3 * 40 = 120 yellow candies.
3. There were half as many blue candies as yellow candies, so there were 120 / 2 = 60 blue candies.

Next, the Carlo Rosi is four times as old as the Twin Valley. Let's denote the Twin Valley's age as TV. So, Carlo Rosi = 4 * TV.

Since the Silver Ridge is the same age as the Franzia, Silver Ridge = Franzia = 120 years.

Now we have three equations with three variables:

1. Carlo Rosi = 4 * TV
2. Franzia = 120
3. Silver Ridge = 120

From equation 3, we know that the Silver Ridge is 120 years old. Since it's the same age as the Franzia, Franzia = 120 years as well.

1. Let A be the number of antelopes, R be the number of rabbits, H be the number of hyenas, W be the number of wild dogs, and Z be the number of zebras.

2. We know that A + R = A + 34 (since there are 34 more rabbits than antelopes).

3. We also know that A + R + H = A + R + A + R - 42 (since there are 42 fewer hyenas than the total number of antelopes and rabbits combined).

4. Since there are 50 more wild dogs than hyenas, we have H = W - 50.

5. The number of leopards is half the number of rabbits, so R / 2 = L (where L is the number of leopards).

6. There are twice as many zebras as leopards, so Z = 2L.

1. Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles.
2. Tom collected three times as many red marbles as Mary, so Tom collected 3 * 60 = 180 red marbles.
3. Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary, so Anie collected 60 + 20 = 80 red marbles.
4. Half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie is equal to the number of blue marbles collected by Mary. Since Mary collected half the number of blue marbles as Jenny, Mary collected 25 / 2 = 12.5 blue marbles (let's round this up to 13 for simplicity).
5. Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary, so Anie collected 80 - 60 = 20 more red marbles than Tom. Since Tom collected three times as many red marbles as Mary, Tom collected 60 / 3 = 20 red marbles.

She also adds 5 8-oz cans of ginger ale. How many 10 oz servings of punch does Carrie have?",18.0,"First, let's calculate the total volume of the punch in ounces.

Mountain Dew: 6 * 12 = 72 oz
Fruit juice: 40 oz
Ice: 28 oz
Ginger ale: 5 * 8 = 40 oz

Total volume = 72 + 40 + 28 + 40 = 180 oz

Now, let's find out how many 10 oz servings Carrie has.

Number of 10 oz servings = Total volume / Ounces per serving

Since 10 oz is less than the total volume, we cannot divide the total volume directly by 10. Instead, we need to find a multiple of 10 that is greater than or equal to the total volume and then divide by that multiple.

The next multiple of 10 greater than 180 is 200. So, we have:

Number of 10 oz servings = Total volume / 10 = 180 / 10 = 18

However, since we used a multiple of 10 that is greater than the total volume, we need to subtract the remaining 20 oz from the number of servings we calculated:

Number of 10 oz servings = 18 - (20 / 10) = 18 - 2 = 16

If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",285.0,"First, let's find out how many pieces of bread Jane brings. Since Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats, and we know Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, we can assume that Wanda's treats are 90/3 = 30 treats. So, Jane's treats are 30 * 4/3 = 40 treats. Therefore, Jane brings 90 - 40 = 50 pieces of bread.

Next, let's find out how many pieces of bread Wanda, Wanda, and Carlos bring together. We know Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, and since Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, she brings 3 * 30 = 90 pieces of bread in total.

Carlos brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats, and since Jane brings 40 treats, Carlos brings 40 * 2 = 80 pieces of bread.

Now, let's add the number of pieces of bread each person brought: 50 (Jane) + 90 (Wanda) + 80 (Carlos) = 220 pieces of bread in total.

Since Wanda brings 30 treats, and Jane and Carlos bring the same number of treats as they bring of bread (in multiples of 3 and 2, respectively), the total number of treats they bring is also 220.

1. Let's denote the number of rehabilitation centers visited by Han as H. Since Han visited 2 less than twice as many as Jude, Jude visited H/2 rehabilitation centers.

2. Omar visited 3 more rehabilitation centers than Jude, so Omar visited (H/2) + 3 rehabilitation centers.

3. Jane visited 6 more than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Han, so Jane visited 2(H) + 6 rehabilitation centers.

Safari National park also has twice as many zebras as giraffes. Savanna National park has half as many zebras as lions. How many animals in total does Savanna National park have?",510.0,"Let's break this down:

1. Safari National Park has 100 lions, half as many snakes (which is 100/2 = 50 snakes), and 10 fewer giraffes than snakes, so it has 50 - 10 = 40 giraffes. Since it has twice as many zebras as giraffes, it has 40 * 2 = 80 zebras.

2. Savanna National Park has double the number of lions as Safari National Park, so it has 100 * 2 = 200 lions. It has triple the number of snakes as Safari National Park, so it has 50 * 3 = 150 snakes. It has 20 more giraffes than Safari National Park, so it has 40 + 20 = 60 giraffes. Since it has half as many zebras as lions, it has 200 / 2 = 100 zebras.

Now, let's add up all the animals in Savanna National Park:

Total animals = Lions + Snakes + Giraffes + Zebras = 200 + 150 + 60 + 100 = 510 animals.

He also buys 4 alpacas that cost 25% less each than a llama. How much did he spend?,6600.0,"First, let's find the cost of the goats:

Goats cost: 3 * $400 = $1200

Next, let's find the number of llamas. Since Tim gets twice as many llamas as goats, he gets 6 llamas. Now, let's find the cost of each llama by saying that one llama costs x dollars. Since they cost 50% more than a llama, a llama costs (100 - 50) / 100 * x = 0.5 * x dollars. Now, let's find the cost of all llamas:

Llamas cost: 6 * 0.5 * x = 3 * x

Next, let's find the cost of alpacas. Since they cost 25% less than a llama, an alpaca costs 0.75 * x dollars. Now, let's find the cost of all alpacas:

Alpacas cost: 4 * 0.75 * x = 3 * 0.75 * x

Now, let's add up the costs of all animals:

Total cost = Goats cost + Llamas cost + Alpacas cost
          = $1200 + 3 * x + 3 * 0.75 * x

Since we don't know the exact cost of one llama, we can't find the exact total cost. However, we can express the total cost in terms of the cost of one llama:

Under optimal wind conditions, the use of two sails brings the ship to the speed of 50 knots, whereas under the same conditions, the use of one sail brings her ship to the speed of 25 knots. A knot is a nautical term for speed equal to 1 nautical mile per hour, and one nautical mile equals 1.15 land miles. If she travels in her sailboat under optimal wind conditions for 4 hours with one sail and then for another 4 hours with two sails, Under the same conditions, the use of three sails brings the ship to the speed of 60 knots, and she sails for 1 hour using three sails. what is the total distance, in land miles, that she will travel?",414.0,"First, let's find the speed in miles per hour for one sail (25 knots) and two sails (50 knots).

1 knot = 1 nautical mile per hour = (1 * 1.15) land miles per hour

Speed with one sail: 25 knots * 1.15 = 28.75 miles per hour
Speed with two sails: 50 knots * 1.15 = 57.5 miles per hour

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled with one sail for 4 hours:

Distance with one sail = Speed with one sail * Time with one sail
                                      = 28.75 miles per hour * 4 hours
                                      = 115 miles

Similarly, let's calculate the distance traveled with two sails for 4 hours:

Distance with two sails = Speed with two sails * Time with two sails
                                          = 57.5 miles per hour * 4 hours
                                          = 230 miles

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled with three sails for 1 hour:

Distance with three sails = Speed with three sails * Time with three sails
                                            = 60 knots * 1.15 * 1 hour

4. Bananas: 3 kg * $5/kg = $15
5. Rice: 4 kg * $6/kg = $24

Now, let's add up the costs:

Total cost = $12 (potatoes) + $27 (tomatoes) + $20 (cucumbers) + $15 (bananas) + $24 (rice) = $98

1 bowl of ice cream * $3/bowl = $3

So, Mell's total cost is $8 + $7 + $3 = $18.

Now, let's calculate the cost for the other three friends who ordered the same as Mell (2 cups of coffee, 1 piece of cake, and 1 bowl of ice cream):
3 friends * (2 cups of coffee * $4/cup + 1 piece of cake * $7/piece + 1 bowl of ice cream * $3/bowl) =

He needs to know how many pieces to cut the lasagna into to serve it. Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Another friend, Nora, is picky and will only eat one-third of what Manny eats, and Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",7.0,"First, let's calculate the amount of lasagna each person will eat, excluding Manny:

1. Aaron will not eat lasagna, so he won't take any pieces.
2. Kai will eat twice as much as Manny, so Kai will eat 2 * Manny's pieces.
3. Raphael eats half the amount Manny does, so Raphael will eat 0.5 * Manny's pieces.
4. Lisa eats two pieces, plus any leftover from Raphael's piece. If Raphael eats 0.5 * Manny's pieces, then Lisa will eat 2 + 0.5 * Manny's pieces.
5. Nora eats one-third of what Manny eats, and Lisa eats whatever Nora leaves of her piece. So, if Manny eats one piece, Nora will eat 1/3 of a piece, and Lisa will eat (1 - 1/3) * Manny's pieces = 2/3 * Manny's pieces.

Now, let's find the total amount of lasagna needed for everyone except Manny:

Total_lasagna = Kai's pieces + Raphael's pieces + Lisa's pieces + Nora's pieces
Total_lasagna = 2 * Manny's pieces + 0.5 * Manny's pieces + (2 + 0.5 * Manny's pieces) + (2/3 * Manny's pieces)

Since Manny only wants one piece for himself, we can set the total amount of lasagna needed for the others equal to the total number of pieces minus Manny's piece:

Total_lasagna = (2 * Manny's pieces + 0.5 * Manny's pieces + 2 + 0.5 * Manny's pieces + 2/3 * Manny's pieces) - 1

Now, we can solve for Manny's pieces:

Manny's pieces = (Total_lasagna + 1) / (2 + 0.5 + 2 + 0.5 + 2/3)
Manny's pieces = (Total_lasagna + 1) / 7.5

Since we don't know the exact number of people Manny is inviting, we can't find the exact number of pieces Manny should cut his lasagna into. However, we can find the number of pieces if we know the total number of lasagna pieces Manny has. To do that, we can rearrange the equation to find Total_lasagna:

Total_lasagna = 7.5 * Manny's pieces - 1

For example, if Manny has 15 pieces of lasagna, then:

Total_lasagna = 7.5 * Manny's pieces - 1
Total_lasagna = 7.5 * 15 - 1
Total_lasagna = 112.5 - 1

Since there's no information about the cost of blue women's t-shirts, we can't find the cost for them. However, we can still find the total cost for men's t-shirts.

There are 2 sectors using white and black t-shirts, so there are 20 men (2 sectors * 10 men per sector) for each color. The total cost for white men's t-shirts is 20 * $20 = $400. The total cost for black men's t-shirts is 20 * $18 = $360. The total cost for blue men's t-shirts is 10 * $22 = $220.
