Explanation:
Toulouse has 2 times as many sheep as Charleston.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
Seattle has 2 times as many sheep as Alice.
How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle and Alice have together if Alice has 20 sheep?
Let's start with Alice. She has 20 sheep.
Seattle has 2 times as many sheep as Alice. So Seattle has 2 times 20 = 40 sheep.
Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So Charleston has 4 times 40 = 160 sheep.
Toulouse has 2 times as many sheep as Charleston. So Toulouse has 2 times 160 = 320 sheep.
Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle and Alice have together 20 + 40 + 160 + 320 = 540 sheep.",540,540.0,True,

She decided to count each animal she saw and calculated their total number. She counted 80 antelopes, 34 more rabbits than antelopes, 42 fewer hyenas than the total number of antelopes and rabbits combined, 50 more wild dogs than hyenas, and the number of leopards was half the number of rabbits. There were also twice as many zebras as leopards. What is the total number of animals that Josie counted?",719.0,"0.5

Explanation:
Let the number of antelopes be x.
The number of rabbits is x + 34.
The number of hyenas is x + x + 34 - 42 = 2x + 32.
The number of wild dogs is 2x + 32 + 50 = 2x + 82.
The number of leopards is (x + 34)/2 = (x + 17).
The number of zebras is 2(x + 17).
The total number of animals is x + x + 34 + 2x + 32 + 2x + 82 + x + 17 + 2(x + 17) = 7x + 182.

Anie collected 2x+20 red marbles and 2y blue marbles
Tom collected 3x red marbles and y-5 blue marbles
Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles
We can now write down the equations:
2x + x/2 = 2y + 20
3x = 2x + 20
y - 5 = 25
We can now solve the equations:
2x + x/2 = 2y + 20
2x + x = 4y + 40
3x = 2x + 20
x = 20
y - 5 = 25
y = 30
We can now find the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together:
x/2 + 2y + y - 5 = 100
x/2 + 3y = 100
20/2 + 3*30 = 100
10 + 90 = 100
100 = 100
The total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is 100.",100,100.0,False,

If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",285.0,"270

Explanation:
Let x be the number of treats that Jane brought.
Then, Jane brought 0.75x pieces of bread.
Wanda brought 0.5x pieces of bread and 3x pieces of treats.
Carlos brought 0.33x pieces of bread and 2x pieces of treats.
Wanda brought 90 pieces of bread.
0.5x + 3x = 90

Jane brought 30 pieces of treats and 0.75(30) = 22.5 pieces of bread.
Wanda brought 30 pieces of treats and 0.5(30) = 15 pieces of bread.
Carlos brought 30 pieces of treats and 0.33(30) = 10 pieces of bread.
The total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo is 30 + 22.5 + 15 + 10 = 77.5 + 30 = 107.5.

If Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers, how many rehabilitation centers did they all visit in total, assuming they are all different?",33.0,"36

Explanation:
Let's start by assigning variables to each person's number of rehabilitation centers visited. We'll call Jane's number of rehabilitation centers visited $J$, Han's number of rehabilitation centers visited $H$, Jude's number of rehabilitation centers visited $J$, and Lisa's number of rehabilitation centers visited $L$.
We can then use the information given in the problem to write equations for each person's number of rehabilitation centers visited. We'll start with Jane:
$J = 6 + 2L$
We can then write an equation for Han:
$H = 2 + 2J$
We can then write an equation for Jude:
$J = 2 + 2H$
We can then write an equation for Lisa:
$L = 2 + 2J$
We can then write an equation for Omar:
$O = 3 + 2J$
We can then solve for $J$ by substituting the equation for $H$ into the equation for $J$:
$J = 2 + 2(2 + 2J)$
$J = 2 + 4 + 4J$
$J = 6 + 4J$
$5J = 6$
$J = \frac{6}{5}$
We can then substitute the value of $J$ into the equation for $L$ to find $L$:
$L = 2 + 2(\frac{6}{5})$
$L = 2 + \frac{12}{5}$
$L = \frac{14}{5}$
We can then substitute the values of $J$ and $L$ into the equation for $O$ to find $O$:
$O = 3 + 2(\frac{6}{5})$
$O = 3 + \frac{12}{5}$
$O = \frac{33}{5}$
We can then substitute the values of $J$, $L$, and $O$ into the equation for $H$ to find $H$:
$H = 2 + 2(\frac{6}{5})$
$H = 2 + \frac{12}{5}$
$H = \frac{14}{5}$
We can then substitute the values of $J$, $L$, and $O$ into the equation for $J$ to find $J$:
$J = 2 + 2(\frac{14}{5})$
$J = 2 + \frac{28}{5}$
$J = \frac{30}{5}$
We can then add the values of $J$, $L$, $O$, and $H$ to find the total number of rehabilitation centers visited:
$\frac{6}{5} + \frac{14}{5} + \frac{33}{5} + \frac{14}{5} = \frac{67}{5}$
$\frac{67}{5} = 13.4$

Explanation:
Borgnine needs to see 1,100 legs at the zoo. He has already seen 12 chimps, 8 lions, and 5 lizards. He also saw 8 penguins. He is next headed to see the tarantulas. How many tarantulas does he need to see to meet his goal?

The number of legs on a chimp is 4. The number of legs on a lion is 4. The number of legs on a lizard is 4. The number of legs on a penguin is 2. The number of legs on a tarantula is 8.

The number of legs Borgnine has seen so far is 12 chimps x 4 legs = 48 legs + 8 lions x 4 legs = 32 legs + 5 lizards x 4 legs = 20 legs + 8 penguins x 2 legs = 16 legs = 116 legs.

The number of legs Borgnine needs to see is 1,100 legs - 116 legs = 984 legs.

If his farm produced 400 kg of mangoes and he sold the fruits at $50 per kg, calculate the total amount of money he got in that season.",125000.0,"20000

Explanation:
Let the total produce of mangoes be x kg.
Then, the total produce of apples = 2x kg
and the total produce of oranges = x + 200 kg
The total produce of bananas = 2x – 100 kg
Total amount of money = 400 x 50 = 20000

Explanation:
Opal won $100.00 betting on a horse race. She put half of her winnings into savings and bet the other half of her winnings. This time, she made a 60% profit and again, put half of her earnings into savings. She then bet the money she did not put into savings, made a 25% profit, and again put half of her new earnings into savings. How much money in total did she put into her savings?
First, we need to find out how much money she bet. She put half of her winnings into savings, so she bet the other half. Half of $100.00 is $50.00, so she bet $50.00.
She made a 60% profit, so she made 60% of $50.00, which is 0.6 x 50 = 30.00. She put half of this into savings, so she put 0.5 x 30 = 15.00 into savings.
She then bet the money she did not put into savings, which is 30.00 - 15.00 = 15.00. She made a 25% profit, so she made 25% of 15.00, which is 0.25 x 15 = 3.75. She put half of this into savings, so she put 0.5 x 3.75 = 1.875 into savings.
She put 15.00 + 1.875 = 16.875 into savings, so she put a total of 15.00 + 1.875 = 16.875 into savings.",16.875,16.875,False,

He needs to know how many pieces to cut the lasagna into to serve it. Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Another friend, Nora, is picky and will only eat one-third of what Manny eats, and Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",7.0,"12

For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",64.0,"48

Explanation:
Let the number of red gumballs be x.
The number of blue gumballs is half of the number of red gumballs, so the number of blue gumballs is x/2.
The number of green gumballs is 4 times the number of blue gumballs, so the number of green gumballs is 4x/2 = 2x.
The number of yellow gumballs is the same as the number of blue gumballs, so the number of yellow gumballs is x/2.
The total number of gumballs is the sum of the number of red, blue, green, and yellow gumballs, so the total number of gumballs is x + x/2 + 2x + x/2 = 5x/2.
The problem states that the machine has 16 red gumballs, so x = 16.
The total number of gumballs is 5x/2 = 5(16)/2 = 80/2 = 40.
The machine has 40 gumballs.",40,40.0,False,
