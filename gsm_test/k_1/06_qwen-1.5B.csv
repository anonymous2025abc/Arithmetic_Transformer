1. **Determine the number of red candies:**
   The problem states that there are 40 red candies.

2. **Calculate the number of yellow candies:**
   The number of yellow candies is given as 20 less than three times the number of red candies. So, we can express this relationship with the following equation:

There were also twice as many zebras as leopards. What is the total number of animals that Josie counted?",719.0,"To find the total number of animals Josie counted, we need to calculate the number of each type of animal based on the given information.

1. **Antelopes**: Josie counted 80 antelopes.
   \[
   A = 80

2. **Rabbits**: The number of rabbits is 34 more than the number of antelopes.
   \[
   R = A + 34 = 80 + 34 = 114
   \]

3. **Hyenas**: The number of hyenas is 42 fewer than the total number of antelopes and rabbits combined.
   \[
   H = (A + R) - 42 = (80 + 114) - 42 = 194 - 42 = 152

4. **Wild Dogs**: The number of wild dogs is 50 more than the number of hyenas.
   \[
   W = H + 50 = 152 + 50 = 202

5. **Leopards**: The number of leopards is half the number of rabbits.

1. **Determine the length of the pen:**
   - The pen is longer than the rubber by 3 centimeters.
   - Let \( R \) be the length of the rubber.
   - Therefore, the length of the pen is \( R + 3 \) cm.

2. **Determine the length of the pen again using the pencil's length:**
   - The pen is shorter than the pencil by 2 centimeters.
   - Given that the pencil is 12 cm long, the length of the pen is \( 12 - 2 = 10 \) cm.
   - So, \( R + 3 = 10 \).
   - Solving for \( R \), we get \( R = 10 - 3 = 7 \) cm.

3. **Determine the length of the pen (repeatedly):**
   - We already found that the pen is 10 cm long from the pencil's length.

4. **Determine the length of the marker:**
   - The marker is 1 centimeter longer than the pencil.
   - Since the pencil is 12 cm long, the length of the marker is \( 12 + 1 = 13 \) cm.

5. **Sum the lengths of all the items:**
   - Rubber: \( R = 7 \) cm
   - Pen: 10 cm
   - Pencil: 12 cm
   - Marker: 13 cm

Now, let's add these lengths together:

\[

They also have a younger brother named Liam who is 1 year younger than the youngest of the three oldest brothers. How old is the youngest brother?,30.0,"Let's denote the age of the youngest brother as \( x \). Since the ages of the three oldest brothers are consecutive integers and their total age is 96, we can express the ages of the three oldest brothers as \( x-2 \), \( x-1 \), and \( x+1 \).

According to the problem, the sum of these three ages is 96. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
(x - 2) + (x - 1) + (x + 1) = 96
\]

First, let's simplify the left side of the equation by combining like terms:

\[
x - 2 + x - 1 + x + 1 = 96
\]
\[
3x - 2 = 96

Next, we need to isolate \( x \). To do this, add 2 to both sides of the equation:

\[
3x - 2 + 2 = 96 + 2

\[
3x = 98

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{98}{3}

\[
x = 32.67

Since the ages must be whole numbers, it seems there might be an error in the interpretation or the given conditions. However, if we assume the problem allows for non-whole number solutions, then the youngest brother would be approximately 32.67 years old.

But typically, such problems expect whole number solutions unless otherwise specified. If we were to round down to the nearest whole number, the youngest brother would be 32 years old. But since the exact solution involves fractions, the precise answer based on the given information is:

First, let's define the variables for each type of fruit:

- Let \( A \) be the total produce of apples (in kg).
- Let \( M \) be the total produce of mangoes (in kg).
- Let \( O \) be the total produce of oranges (in kg).

From the problem statement, we know:
1. The total produce of apples was twice the total produce of mangoes:

Each member of the family (including John) has to pay the initial joining fee of $4000. Since there are 4 people in the family:

\[
\text{Total joining fees} = 4 \times \$4000 = \$16000

- **Giraffes**: SNP has 10 fewer giraffes than snakes, so \( 50 - 10 = 40 \) giraffes.

Now, let's calculate the number of zebras in SNP. Since SNP has twice as many zebras as giraffes:

\[ \text{Zebras in SNP} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \]

So, the total number of animals in SNP is:

\[ 100 (\text{lions}) + 50 (\text{snakes}) + 40 (\text{giraffes}) + 80 (\text{zebras}) = 270 \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of animals in SNP

- **Lions**: SNP has double as many lions as SNP, so \( 2 \times 100 = 200 \) lions.
- **Snakes**: SNP has triple as many snakes as SNP, so \( 3 \times 50 = 150 \) snakes.
- **Giraffes**: SNP has 20 more giraffes than SNP, so \( 40 + 20 = 60 \) giraffes.

Now, let's calculate the number of zebras in SNP. Since SNP has half as many zebras as lions:

   - The total cost for the llamas is:
     \[
     6 \times 600 = 3600

One more friend, Nina, ordered the same as Mell, but she also bought 2 bowls of ice cream. How much money did Mell and her friends need to pay at the cafeteria?",72.0,"To determine how much money Mell and her friends needed to pay at the cafeteria, we will calculate the cost for each person individually and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the total cost for Mell:
- Mell ordered 2 cups of coffee and 1 piece of cake.
- The cost of 2 cups of coffee is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.
- The cost of 1 piece of cake is \(7\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for Mell is \(8 + 7 = 15\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for each of Mell's three friends:
- Each friend ordered 2 cups of coffee and 1 piece of cake.
- The cost of 2 cups of coffee is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.
- The cost of 1 piece of cake is \(7\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for each friend is \(8 + 7 = 15\) dollars.

Since there are three friends, the total cost for all three friends is \(3 \times 15 = 45\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost for Nina:
- Nina ordered the same as Mell (2 cups of coffee and 1 piece of cake) plus 2 bowls of ice cream.
- The cost of 2 cups of coffee is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.
- The cost of 1 piece of cake is \(7\) dollars.
- The cost of 2 bowls of ice cream is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.

   - Manny wants 1 piece.

2. **Aaron's Preferences:**
   - Aaron likes garlic bread and salad and will not eat lasagna at all.

3. **Kai's Preferences:**
   - Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny.

How much did he spend total on buying t-shirts?",1050.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each type of shirt (men's or women's) and then sum up the costs for all sectors.

First, let's determine the price of men's t-shirts:

- White men's t-shirts: $20
- Black men's t-shirts: $18

Since women's t-shirts are $5 cheaper than men's t-shirts of the same color, we can find the price of women's t-shirts as follows:

- Price of white women's t-shirts = $20 - $5 = $15
- Price of black women's t-shirts = $18 - $5 = $13

Next, we calculate the total cost for each sector:

Each sector contains 10 men and 10 women, making a total of 20 people per sector. Since there are three sectors, the total number of people is:

\[ 20 \text{ people/sector} \times 3 \text{ sectors} = 60 \text{ people} \]

Now, we calculate the total cost for each type of shirt across all sectors:

What is the total number of legs in his entire collection?,166.0,"To determine the total number of legs in Monroe's collection, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of insect separately and then sum them up.

First, let's consider the spiders:
- Each spider has 8 legs.
- Monroe has 8 spiders.
So, the total number of legs from the spiders is:
\[ 8 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs/spider} = 64 \text{ legs} \]

Next, let's consider the ants:
- Each ant has 6 legs.
- Monroe has 12 ants.
So, the total number of legs from the ants is:
\[ 12 \text{ ants} \times 6 \text{ legs/ant} = 72 \text{ legs} \]

Now, let's consider the beetles:
- We don't know how many beetles Monroe has, but we can assume he has at least one beetle since the question doesn't specify otherwise.
- Let's denote the number of beetles as \( b \).
So, the total number of legs from the beetles is:
\[ b \text{ beetles} \times 6 \text{ legs/beetle} = 6b \text{ legs} \]

The total number of legs in Monroe's entire collection is the sum of the legs from the spiders, the ants, and the beetles:
\[ 64 + 72 + 6b \]

Since the problem does not provide the exact number of beetles, we cannot determine the exact total number of legs without that information. However, if we assume there are no other insects (which would be the most common assumption when only specific numbers of certain types of insects are given), then the total number of legs would simply be the sum of the legs from the spiders and the ants.

- \( G \) as the number of green gumballs,
- \( B \) as the number of blue gumballs,
- \( Y \) as the number of yellow gumballs.

From the problem statement, we have the following relationships:

1. The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs:
