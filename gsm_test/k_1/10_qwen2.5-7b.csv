How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle and Alice have together if Alice has 20 sheep?",540.0,"To determine the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle, and Alice have together, we start by defining the number of sheep each city has based on the information given.

1. Let \( A \) be the number of sheep Alice has. According to the problem, Alice has 20 sheep.
   \[
   A = 20
   \]

2. Seattle has 2 times as many sheep as Alice. Therefore, the number of sheep Seattle has is:
   \[
   S = 2A = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

3. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, the number of sheep Charleston has is:
   \[
   C = 4S = 4 \times 40 = 160

1. **Determine the number of treats Wanda brought:**
   Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats. Given that Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   3t_W = 90
   \]
   Solving for \( t_W \):
   \[
   t_W = \frac{90}{3} = 30
   \]
   So, Wanda brings 30 treats.

2. **Determine the number of treats Jane brought:**
   Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   t_W = \frac{1}{2} t_J

   Substituting \( t_W = 30 \):
   \[
   30 = \frac{1}{2} t_J

First, let's calculate the number of legs for each type of animal Borgnine has seen:

1. **Chimps**: Each chimp has 2 legs.
   \[
   12 \text{ chimps} \times 2 \text{ legs per chimp} = 24 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. **Lions**: Each lion has 4 legs.
   \[
   8 \text{ lions} \times 4 \text{ legs per lion} = 32 \text{ legs}

4. **Penguins**: Each penguin has 2 legs.
   \[

Borgnine wants to see a total of 1100 legs. To find out how many more legs he needs to see, we subtract the number of legs he has already seen from his goal:
\[
1100 \text{ legs} - 92 \text{ legs} = 1008 \text{ legs}
\]

Each tarantula has 8 legs. To find out how many tarantulas he needs to see, we divide the remaining number of legs by the number of legs per tarantula:
\[
\frac{1008 \text{ legs}}{8 \text{ legs per tarantula}} = 126 \text{ tarantulas}

They also have a younger brother named Liam who is 1 year younger than the youngest of the three oldest brothers. How old is the youngest brother?,30.0,"To determine the age of the youngest brother, we start by defining the ages of the three oldest brothers. Let's denote the age of the youngest brother by \( x \). Since the ages are consecutive integers, the age of the middle brother is \( x+1 \) and the age of the oldest brother is \( x+2 \).

According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 96. Therefore, we can write the following equation:
\[
x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 96
\]

Next, we combine like terms on the left side of the equation:
\[
3x + 3 = 96
\]

To isolate \( x \), we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[
3x = 93
\]

Then, we divide both sides by 3:
\[
x = 31
\]

So, the age of the youngest brother is \( 31 \). Since Liam is 1 year younger than the youngest brother, Liam's age is \( 31 - 1 = 30 \). However, the problem asks for the age of the youngest brother, which is \( 31 \).

Under optimal wind conditions, the use of two sails brings the ship to the speed of 50 knots, whereas under the same conditions, the use of one sail brings her ship to the speed of 25 knots. A knot is a nautical term for speed equal to 1 nautical mile per hour, and one nautical mile equals 1.15 land miles. If she travels in her sailboat under optimal wind conditions for 4 hours with one sail and then for another 4 hours with two sails, Under the same conditions, the use of three sails brings the ship to the speed of 60 knots, and she sails for 1 hour using three sails. what is the total distance, in land miles, that she will travel?",414.0,"To determine the total distance Buffy travels in land miles, we need to calculate the distance she covers with each set of sails and then sum these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Buffy travels with one sail:
- Speed with one sail: 25 knots
- Time traveled with one sail: 4 hours

\[
\text{Distance with one sail} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 25 \text{ knots} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 100 \text{ nautical miles}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Buffy travels with two sails:
- Speed with two sails: 50 knots
- Time traveled with two sails: 4 hours

\[
\text{Distance with two sails} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \text{ knots} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ nautical miles}
\]

Then, let's calculate the distance Buffy travels with three sails:
- Speed with three sails: 60 knots
- Time traveled with three sails: 1 hour

\[
\text{Distance with three sails} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \text{ knots} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ nautical miles}
\]

Now, we sum the distances traveled with each set of sails to find the total distance in nautical miles:

\[
\text{Total distance in nautical miles} = 100 \text{ nautical miles} + 200 \text{ nautical miles} + 60 \text{ nautical miles} = 360 \text{ nautical miles}
\]

Finally, we convert the total distance from nautical miles to land miles. Since 1 nautical mile equals 1.15 land miles:

\[
\text{Total distance in land miles} = 360 \text{ nautical miles} \times 1.15 \text{ land miles per nautical mile} = 414 \text{ land miles}

One more friend, Nina, ordered the same as Mell, but she also bought 2 bowls of ice cream. How much money did Mell and her friends need to pay at the cafeteria?",72.0,"To determine the total amount of money Mell and her friends needed to pay at the cafeteria, we will calculate the cost of each person's order and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost of Mell's order:
- Mell ordered 2 cups of coffee and 1 piece of cake.
- The cost of one cup of coffee is $4, so the cost of 2 cups is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.
- The cost of one piece of cake is $7.
- Therefore, the total cost of Mell's order is \(8 + 7 = 15\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of each of Mell's two friends' orders:
- Each friend ordered 2 cups of coffee, 1 piece of cake, and 1 bowl of ice cream.
- The cost of one cup of coffee is $4, so the cost of 2 cups is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.
- The cost of one piece of cake is $7.
- The cost of one bowl of ice cream is $3.
- Therefore, the total cost of each friend's order is \(8 + 7 + 3 = 18\) dollars.

Since there are two friends, the total cost for both friends is \(2 \times 18 = 36\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the cost of Nina's order:
- Nina ordered the same as Mell, which is 2 cups of coffee and 1 piece of cake, plus 2 bowls of ice cream.
- The cost of one cup of coffee is $4, so the cost of 2 cups is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.
- The cost of one piece of cake is $7.
- The cost of two bowls of ice cream is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of Nina's order is \(8 + 7 + 6 = 21\) dollars.

Finally, let's sum the costs of all the orders:
- The total cost for Mell is $15.
- The total cost for the two friends is $36.
- The total cost for Nina is $21.

He needs to know how many pieces to cut the lasagna into to serve it. Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Another friend, Nora, is picky and will only eat one-third of what Manny eats, and Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",7.0,"To determine how many pieces Manny should cut his lasagna into, we need to calculate the amount each person will eat based on the given conditions. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Manny's Consumption:**
   Manny will eat 1 piece.

2. **Aaron's Consumption:**
   Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will eat 0 pieces.

3. **Kai's Consumption:**
   Kai will eat twice as much as Manny.
   \[
   \text{Kai's consumption} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Raphael's Consumption:**
   Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does.
   \[
   \text{Raphael's consumption} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 = 0.5 \text{ pieces}
   \]

5. **Lisa's Consumption:**
   Lisa will eat 2 pieces plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Raphael has 0.5 pieces, so Lisa will eat:
   \[
   \text{Lisa's consumption} = 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 \text{ pieces}
   \]

6. **Nora's Consumption:**
   Nora will eat one-third of what Manny eats.
   \[
   \text{Nora's consumption} = \frac{1}{3} \times 1 = \frac{1}{3} \text{ pieces}
   \]
   Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. Nora leaves:
   \[
   \text{Nora's leave} = 2.5 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{7.5}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{6.5}{3} = \frac{13}{6} \text{ pieces}
   \]
   Lisa will eat:
   \[
   \text{Lisa's consumption} = \frac{13}{6} \text{ pieces}
   \]

7. **Total Consumption:**
   Now, we sum up the consumption of all the friends:
   \[
   \text{Total consumption} = \text{Manny's consumption} + \text{Aaron's consumption} + \text{Kai's consumption} + \text{Raphael's consumption} + \text{Lisa's consumption} + \text{Nora's consumption}
   \]
   Converting all values to fractions for easier addition:
   \[
   \text{Manny's consumption} = 1 = \frac{6}{6}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Aaron's consumption} = 0 = \frac{0}{6}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Kai's consumption} = 2 = \frac{12}{6}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Raphael's consumption} = 0.5 = \frac{3}{6}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Lisa's consumption} = \frac{13}{6}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Nora's consumption} = \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{6}

   Adding these fractions:
   \[
   \text{Total consumption} = \frac{6}{6} + \frac{0}{6} + \frac{12}{6} + \frac{3}{6} + \frac{13}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \text{ pieces}
