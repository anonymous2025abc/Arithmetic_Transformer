     1 \times 2 = 2 \text{ points}

3. **Final Scores:**
   - Dunkinville Hornets' final score:
     \[
     86 + 2 = 88 \text{ points}
     \]
   - Fredingo Fireflies' final score:
     \[
     74 + 6 = 80 \text{ points}

4. **Difference in Final Scores:**
   - Difference between the Fireflies and the Hornets:
     \[
     80 - 88 = -8 \text{ points}
     \]
   - Since we need how many more points the Fireflies scored compared to the Hornets, we take the absolute value:
     \[

- Let \( B_A \) be the number of blue marbles Anie collected.
- Let \( R_T \) be the number of red marbles Tom collected.
- Let \( B_T \) be the number of blue marbles Tom collected.

We know from the problem that:
1. Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles:

### Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled with three sails
- Speed with three sails: 60 knots
- Time: 1 hour

\[ \text{Distance}_3 = 60 \, \text{knots} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 60 \, \text{nautical miles} \]

1. **Manny**: Manny wants one piece.
2. **Aaron**: Aaron won't eat any lasagna.
3. **Kai**: Kai will eat twice as much as Manny. Since Manny eats 1 piece, Kai will eat \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pieces.
4. **Raphael**: Raphael eats half the amount Manny does. So, Raphael will eat \(0.5 \times 1 = 0.5\) pieces.
5. **Lisa**: Lisa will eat two pieces plus any leftover from Raphael. Since Raphael eats 0.5 pieces, Lisa will eat \(2 + (0.5 - 0.5) = 2\) pieces (since Raphael's 0.5 piece is fully eaten by Lisa).
6. **Nora**: Nora will eat one-third of what Manny eats. So, Nora will eat \(\frac{1}{3} \times 1 = \frac{1}{3}\) piece.
7. **Lisa again**: Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. Since Nora eats \(\frac{1}{3}\) piece, Lisa will eat \(1 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}\) piece.

What is the total number of legs in his entire collection?,166.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs contributed by each type of insect in Monroe's collection and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the number of legs from the spiders:**
   - Spiders have 8 legs each.
   - Monroe has 8 spiders.
   - Total legs from spiders = \(8 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs/spider} = 64 \text{ legs}\).

2. **Calculate the number of legs from the ants:**
   - Ants have 6 legs each.
   - Monroe has 12 ants.
   - Total legs from ants = \(12 \text{ ants} \times 6 \text{ legs/ant} = 72 \text{ legs}\).

3. **Calculate the number of legs from the beetles:**
   - Beetles have 6 legs each.
   - Monroe has 5 beetles.
   - Total legs from beetles = \(5 \text{ beetles} \times 6 \text{ legs/beetle} = 30 \text{ legs}\).
