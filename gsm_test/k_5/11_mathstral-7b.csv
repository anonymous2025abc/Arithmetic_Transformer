How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle, Alice, Bob, David, Zoe and John have together if John has 20 sheep?",65540.0," Let's start by finding out how many sheep each person has, starting from John and working our way up.

John has 20 sheep.

Zoe has 4 times as many sheep as John, so Zoe has 4 * 20 = 80 sheep.

David has 2 times as many sheep as Zoe, so David has 2 * 80 = 160 sheep.

Bob has 3 times as many sheep as David, so Bob has 3 * 160 = 480 sheep.

Alice has 5 times as many sheep as Bob, so Alice has 5 * 480 = 2400 sheep.

Seattle has 2 times as many sheep as Alice, so Seattle has 2 * 2400 = 4800 sheep.

Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 4800 = 19200 sheep.

Toulouse has 2 times as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 19200 = 38400 sheep.

Now, let's add up the number of sheep each person has to find the total:

Toulouse: 38400
Charleston: 19200
Seattle: 4800
Alice: 2400

His last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs. How many DVDs did Billy sell on Tuesday?,120.0," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday. We can do this by multiplying the number of DVDs each customer bought by the number of customers who bought that many DVDs, and then summing up all the results.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The first 3 customers buy 1 DVD each, so that's $3 \times 1 = 3$ DVDs.

2. The next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so that's $2 \times 2 = 4$ DVDs.

3. The next 4 customers buy 3 DVDs each, so that's $4 \times 3 = 12$ DVDs.

4. The next 2 customers buy 8 DVDs each, so that's $2 \times 8 = 16$ DVDs.

5. The next 8 customers buy 9 DVDs each, so that's $8 \times 9 = 72$ DVDs.

6. The next 3 customers buy 2 DVDs each, so that's $3 \times 2 = 6$ DVDs.

7. The next 7 customers buy 1 DVD each, so that's $7 \times 1 = 7$ DVDs.

8. The last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs, so that's $3 \times 0 = 0$ DVDs.

Now, we add up all the DVDs sold:

$3 + 4 + 12 + 16 + 72 + 6 + 7 + 0 = 118$ DVDs.

Therefore, Billy sold a total of $\boxed{118}$ DVDs on Tuesday.",118,118.0,False,

Ed found:
7 limpet shells + 2 oyster shells + 4 conch shells = 7 + 2 + 4 = 13 shells

Jacob found 2 more shells than Ed, so:
13 shells (Ed's total) + 2 shells = 15 shells

Maya found 12 fewer than Jacob, so:
15 shells (Jacob's total) - 12 shells = 3 shells

Liam found 2 more than Maya, so:
3 shells (Maya's total) + 2 shells = 5 shells

Noah found 3 fewer than Liam, so:
5 shells (Liam's total) - 3 shells = 2 shells

Ava found 2 more than Noah, so:
2 shells (Noah's total) + 2 shells = 4 shells

Kitchen: 500 square feet each * 6 kitchens = 3000 square feet
Dining room: 240 square feet each * 5 dining rooms = 1200 square feet
Bathrooms: 150 square feet each * 8 bathrooms = 1200 square feet
Garage: 480 square feet each * 5 garages = 2400 square feet

Total square footage = 600 + 1200 + 3000 + 1200 + 1200 + 2400 + 7200 = 17,600 square feet

Since one gallon of paint covers 600 square feet, we can calculate the number of gallons needed by dividing the total square footage by the coverage of one gallon:

Number of gallons needed = Total square footage / Coverage per gallon
Number of gallons needed = 17,600 square feet / 600 square feet per gallon
Number of gallons needed = 29.3333 gallons

Since Henrietta can't buy a fraction of a gallon, she will need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Henrietta needs 30 gallons of paint to paint her house.

How much did he spend for the night?,514.65," First, let's calculate the cost of the drinks James bought for his friends and himself.

For his friends:
2 rounds for 5 friends = 2 * 5 = 10 drinks
Cost of 10 drinks at $6 each = 10 * $6 = $60

For himself:
6 drinks at $6 each = 6 * $6 = $36

Now, let's calculate the cost of the food he ordered:

Fried chicken = $14
2 nachos at $8.0 each = 2 * $8 = $16
1 bucket of wings at $12.0 each = 1 * $12 = $12
7 bottles of wine at $25.0 each = 7 * $25 = $175
9 shots at $3.5 each = 9 * $3.5 = $31.5
4 dessert platter at $9.0 each = 4 * $9 = $36

Now, let's add up all the costs:

Entry fee = $20
Drinks for friends = $60
Drinks for himself = $36
Fried chicken = $14
Nachos = $16
Wings = $12
Wine = $175
Shots = $31.5
Dessert platter = $36

Total cost before tip = $20 + $60 + $36 + $14 + $16 + $12 + $175 + $31.5 + $36 = $400.5

Now, let's calculate the 30% tip on the total cost of the food and drinks (excluding the entry fee):

Total cost of food and drinks = $60 + $36 + $14 + $16 + $12 + $175 + $31.5 + $36 = $370.5

Tip = 30% of $370.5 = 0.30 * $370.5 = $111.15

Finally, let's add the tip to the total cost before tip to find out how much James spent for the night:

There were also twice as many zebras as leopards. There were also 3 fewer giraffes than zebras. There were also half as many buffaloes as antelopes and rabbits combined. There were also two-thirds as many monkeys as rabbits and leopards combined. There were also 5 more elephants than the total number of wild dogs and hyenas combined. What is the total number of animals that Josie counted?",1400.0," Let's calculate the number of each animal Josie counted:

1. Antelopes: 80
2. Rabbits: 80 (antelopes) + 34 = 114
3. Hyenas: (80 antelopes + 114 rabbits) - 42 = 194 - 42 = 152
4. Wild dogs: 152 (hyenas) + 50 = 202
5. Leopards: 114 (rabbits) / 2 = 57
6. Zebras: 57 (leopards) * 2 = 114
7. Giraffes: 114 (zebras) - 3 = 111
8. Buffaloes: (80 antelopes + 114 rabbits) / 2 = 194 / 2 = 97
9. Monkeys: (114 rabbits + 57 leopards) / 2 = 171 / 2 = 85.5, but since we can't have half an animal, we'll round down to 85.
10. Elephants: 202 (wild dogs) + 152 (hyenas) + 5 = 359

Now, let's add up all the animals:

80 (antelopes) + 114 (rabbits) + 152 (hyenas) + 202 (wild dogs) + 57 (leopards) + 114 (zebras) + 111 (giraffes) + 97 (buffaloes) + 85 (monkeys) + 359 (elephants) = 1262

How many fish do they have in total?,153.0," Let's calculate the number of fish each person has:

1. Micah has 7 fish.
2. Kenneth has 3 times as many fish as Micah, so Kenneth has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
3. Matthias has 15 fewer fish than Kenneth, so Matthias has 21 - 15 = 6 fish.
4. Noah has 7 times as many fish as Micah, so Noah has 7 * 7 = 49 fish.
5. Liam has 5 fewer fish than Kenneth, so Liam has 21 - 5 = 16 fish.
6. Owen has 3 times as many fish as Matthias, so Owen has 3 * 6 = 18 fish.
7. Ethan has 10 fewer fish than Owen, so Ethan has 18 - 10 = 8 fish.
8. Ava has 4 times as many fish as Micah, so Ava has 4 * 7 = 28 fish.

Now, let's add up all the fish:

Micah + Kenneth + Matthias + Noah + Liam + Owen + Ethan + Ava

How many more points did the Fireflies score in the game than did the Hornets?",12.0," Let's calculate the points scored by each team in the final 40 seconds.

Fireflies:
- In the next 5 seconds, they scored 7 three-point baskets: 7 * 3 = 21 points
- In the next 3 seconds, they scored 1 two-point basket: 1 * 2 = 2 points
- In the next 8 seconds, they scored 3 two-point baskets: 3 * 2 = 6 points
- In the next 10 seconds, they scored 2 three-point baskets: 2 * 3 = 6 points

How much, in dollars, will the store need to pay to fill the displays?",1075.0," To calculate the total cost to fill the displays, we need to determine how many more items are needed for each display and then multiply that by the cost per item.

For the necklace stand:
12 (total capacity) - 5 (currently held) = 7 necklaces needed
7 necklaces * $4 per necklace = $28

For the ring display:
30 (total capacity) - 18 (currently held) = 12 rings needed
12 rings * $10 per ring = $120

For the bracelet display:
15 (total capacity) - 8 (currently held) = 7 bracelets needed
7 bracelets * $5 per bracelet = $35

For the watch display:
20 (total capacity) - 7 (currently held) = 13 watchs needed
13 watchs * $25 per watch = $325

For the earring display:
50 (total capacity) - 14 (currently held) = 36 earrings needed
36 earrings * $8 per earring = $288

For the tiara display:
5 (total capacity) - 4 (currently held) = 1 tiara needed
1 tiara * $60 per tiara = $60

For the cufflink display:
25 (total capacity) - 12 (currently held) = 13 cufflinks needed
13 cufflinks * $15 per cufflink = $195

For the brooch display:
18 (total capacity) - 16 (currently held) = 2 broochs needed
2 broochs * $12 per brooch = $24

Ivy collected three times as many blue marbles as Mary. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?",517.0," Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles.

2. Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles.

3. Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary, so Anie collected 60 + 20 = 80 red marbles.

4. Tom collected three times as many red marbles as Mary, so Tom collected 3 * 60 = 180 red marbles.

5. Sara collected 10 fewer red marbles than Anie, so Sara collected 80 - 10 = 70 red marbles.

6. Leo collected three times as many red marbles as Jenny, so Leo collected 3 * 30 = 90 red marbles.

7. Maya collected five times as many red marbles as Tom, so Maya collected 5 * 180 = 900 red marbles.

8. Ivy collected 2 fewer red marbles than Leo, so Ivy collected 90 - 2 = 88 red marbles.

Now, let's calculate the blue marbles:

1. Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, so Anie collected 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles.

2. Sara collected five times as many blue marbles as Mary. Since Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Therefore, Sara collected 5 * 25 = 125 blue marbles.

3. Tom collected 5 fewer blue marbles than Jenny, so Tom collected 25 - 5 = 20 blue marbles.

4. Leo collected three times as many blue marbles as Jenny, so Leo collected 3 * 25 = 75 blue marbles.

5. Maya collected 3 fewer blue marbles than Sara, so Maya collected 125 - 3 = 122 blue marbles.

How many 10 oz servings of punch does Carrie have?",28.0," First, let's calculate the total weight of the punch in ounces:

- Mountain Dew: 6 cans * 12 oz/can = 72 oz
- Ice: 28 oz
- Fruit juice: 40 oz
- Ginger ale: 5 cans * 8 oz/can = 40 oz
- Orange soda: 2 bottles * 15 oz/bottle = 30 oz
- Cranberry juice: 20 oz
- Sherbet: 3 scoops * 10 oz/scoop = 30 oz
- Pineapple chunks: 2 cups * 10 oz/cup = 20 oz

If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",546.0," Let's start by calculating the number of treats and pieces of bread each person brings based on the information provided.

Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread. Since Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, we can calculate the number of treats Wanda brings:
Wanda's treats = 90 pieces of bread / 3 = 30 treats

Now, let's calculate the number of treats and pieces of bread for the other individuals based on Wanda's quantities.

Jane brings half as many treats as Wanda, so:
Jane's treats = 30 treats / 2 = 15 treats
Since Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats, we can calculate the number of pieces of bread Jane brings:
Jane's bread = 15 treats * 0.75 = 11.25 pieces of bread

Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane, so:
Carlos's treats = 15 treats / 3 = 5 treats
Since Carlos brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats, we can calculate the number of pieces of bread Carlos brings:
Carlos's bread = 5 treats * 2 = 10 pieces of bread

Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda, so:
Mia's treats = 30 treats - 10 = 20 treats
Since Mia brings half as many pieces of bread as treats, we can calculate the number of pieces of bread Mia brings:
Mia's bread = 20 treats / 2 = 10 pieces of bread

Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda, so:
Omar's treats = 30 treats * 1.5 = 45 treats
Since Omar brings four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats, we can calculate the number of pieces of bread Omar brings:
Omar's bread = 45 treats * (4/5) = 36 pieces of bread

Priya brings twice as many treats as Carlos, so:
Priya's treats = 5 treats * 2 = 10 treats
Since Priya brings one-fourth as many pieces of bread as treats, we can calculate the number of pieces of bread Priya brings:
Priya's bread = 10 treats / 4 = 2.5 pieces of bread

Elena brings 5 more treats than Mia, so:
Elena's treats = 20 treats + 5 = 25 treats
Since Elena brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, we can calculate the number of pieces of bread Elena brings:
Elena's bread = 25 treats * 3 = 75 pieces of bread

Now, let's add up all the treats and pieces of bread brought by everyone:

Total treats = Jane's treats + Wanda's treats + Carlos's treats + Mia's treats + Omar's treats + Priya's treats + Elena's treats
Total treats = 15 + 30 + 5 + 20 + 45 + 10 + 25 = 150 treats

Total pieces of bread = Jane's bread + Wanda's bread + Carlos's bread + Mia's bread + Omar's bread + Priya's bread + Elena's bread
Total pieces of bread = 11.25 + 90 + 10 + 10 + 36 + 2.5 + 75 = 235 pieces of bread

4. Jane visited 6 more than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Han did, so Jane visited (2 * 4) + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14 rehabilitation centers.
5. Omar visited 3 more rehabilitation centers than Jude did, so Omar visited 3 + 3 = 6 rehabilitation centers.
6. Priya visited 1 less than three times as many rehabilitation centers as Han did, so Priya visited (3 * 4) - 1 = 12 - 1 = 11 rehabilitation centers.
7. Chen visited twice as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa did, so Chen visited 2 * 6 = 12 rehabilitation centers.

There are 4 boxes of crayons that hold 6 green crayons. There are 2 boxes of crayons that hold 9 purple crayons. There are 3 boxes of crayons that hold 10 yellow crayons. There are 5 boxes of crayons that hold 4 brown crayons. There are 1 box of crayons that holds 12 black crayons. How many crayons are there in total?,198.0," To find the total number of crayons, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons in each box for each color and then add them all together.

For orange crayons: 6 boxes * 8 crayons/box = 48 crayons
For blue crayons: 7 boxes * 5 crayons/box = 35 crayons
For red crayons: 1 box * 11 crayons/box = 11 crayons
For green crayons: 4 boxes * 6 crayons/box = 24 crayons
For purple crayons: 2 boxes * 9 crayons/box = 18 crayons
For yellow crayons: 3 boxes * 10 crayons/box = 30 crayons
For brown crayons: 5 boxes * 4 crayons/box = 20 crayons
For black crayons: 1 box * 12 crayons/box = 12 crayons

Now, we add all the crayons together:

48 (orange) + 35 (blue) + 11 (red) + 24 (green) + 18 (purple) + 30 (yellow) + 20 (brown) + 12 (black) = 198 crayons

He also saw 6 elephants. He also saw 12 parrots. He also saw 4 turtles. He also saw 3 scorpions. He is next headed to see the tarantulas. How many tarantulas does he need to see to meet his goal?",115.0," First, let's calculate the total number of legs Borgnine has seen so far.

Chimps have 4 legs each, so 12 chimps have 12 * 4 = 48 legs.
Lions have 4 legs each, so 8 lions have 8 * 4 = 32 legs.
Lizards have 4 legs each, so 5 lizards have 5 * 4 = 20 legs.
Penguins have 2 legs each, so 8 penguins have 8 * 2 = 16 legs.
Elephants have 4 legs each, so 6 elephants have 6 * 4 = 24 legs.
Parrots have 2 legs each, so 12 parrots have 12 * 2 = 24 legs.
Turtles have 4 legs each, so 4 turtles have 4 * 4 = 16 legs.
Scorpions have 6 legs each, so 3 scorpions have 3 * 6 = 18 legs.

Now, let's add up all the legs Borgnine has seen:

48 (chimps) + 32 (lions) + 20 (lizards) + 16 (penguins) + 24 (elephants) + 24 (parrots) + 16 (turtles) + 18 (scorpions) = 198 legs.

Borgnine wants to see a total of 1100 legs. So, the number of legs he still needs to see is:

1100 - 198 = 902 legs.

Tarantulas have 8 legs each. To find out how many tarantulas Borgnine needs to see to meet his goal, we divide the remaining number of legs by the number of legs a tarantula has:

902 / 8 = 112.75.

Since Borgnine can't see a fraction of a tarantula, he needs to see 113 tarantulas to meet his goal of 1100 legs.

A stylus is half as long as the ruler. what is the total length of the rubber, the pen, the pencil, and all the other stationery items mentioned altogether?",96.0," Let's start by determining the lengths of each item based on the information provided:

1. Pencil: Given as 12 centimeters.
2. Pen: Longer than the rubber by 3 centimeters, but we don't know the rubber's length yet.
3. Rubber: We don't have direct information about the rubber's length, but we know the pen is longer than it by 3 centimeters.
4. Marker: 1 centimeter longer than the pencil, so 12 + 1 = 13 centimeters.
5. Crayon: 2 centimeters shorter than the rubber.
6. Ruler: Twice as long as the pencil, so 12 * 2 = 24 centimeters.
7. Paintbrush: 3 centimeters longer than the pen.
8. Stylus: Half as long as the ruler, so 24 / 2 = 12 centimeters.

Now, let's find the length of the rubber and the pen:

Since the pen is longer than the rubber by 3 centimeters, and the pen is also 2 centimeters shorter than the pencil, we can set up the following equation for the rubber's length (let's call it R):

Pen = R + 3
Pen = Pencil - 2
Pen = 12 - 2
Pen = 10 centimeters

Now we know the pen is 10 centimeters long, and since the pen is longer than the rubber by 3 centimeters:

R = Pen - 3
R = 10 - 3
R = 7 centimeters

Now we have the lengths of all items:
- Rubber: 7 centimeters
- Pen: 10 centimeters
- Pencil: 12 centimeters
- Marker: 13 centimeters
- Crayon: 7 - 2 = 5 centimeters
- Ruler: 24 centimeters
- Paintbrush: 10 + 3 = 13 centimeters
- Stylus: 12 centimeters

Let's add them all up to find the total length:

Total length = Rubber + Pen + Pencil + Marker + Crayon + Ruler + Paintbrush + Stylus
Total length = 7 + 10 + 12 + 13 + 5 + 24 + 13 + 12

How old is the youngest brother?,26.0," Let's denote the ages of the three oldest brothers as x, x+1, and x+2, where x is the age of the youngest of the three oldest brothers. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 96:

x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 96

Solving this equation:

3x + 3 = 96
3x = 93
x = 31

So, the youngest of the three oldest brothers is 31 years old.

Now, let's find the ages of the younger brothers:

Liam is 1 year younger than the youngest of the three oldest brothers, so Liam is 31 - 1 = 30 years old.
Noah is 1 year younger than Liam, so Noah is 30 - 1 = 29 years old.
Owen is 1 year younger than Noah, so Owen is 29 - 1 = 28 years old.
Ethan is 1 year younger than Owen, so Ethan is 28 - 1 = 27 years old.
Mason is 1 year younger than Ethan, so Mason is 27 - 1 = 26 years old.

Therefore, the youngest brother, Mason, is 26 years old.

1. Opal won $100.00 initially.
2. She put half into savings, which is $100.00 / 2 = $50.00.
3. She bet the other half, which is also $50.00, and made a 60% profit. The profit is 60% of $50.00, which is 0.60 * $50.00 = $30.00. So, she now has $50.00 + $30.00 = $80.00.
4. She puts half of the $80.00 into savings, which is $80.00 / 2 = $40.00.
5. She bets the other half, which is $40.00, and makes a 25% profit. The profit is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. So, she now has $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00.

7. She bets the other half, which is $25.00, and makes a 20% profit. The profit is 20% of $25.00, which is 0.20 * $25.00 = $5.00. So, she now has $25.00 + $5.00 = $30.00.
8. She puts half of the $30.00 into savings, which is $30.00 / 2 = $15.00.
9. She bets the other half, which is $15.00, and makes a 100% profit. The profit is 100% of $15.00, which is 1.00 * $15.00 = $15.00. So, she now has $15.00 + $15.00 = $30.00.
10. She puts half of the $30.00 into savings, which is $30.00 / 2 = $15.00.
11. She bets the other half, which is $15.00, and makes a 60% profit. The profit is 60% of $15.00, which is 0.60 * $15.00 = $9.00. So, she now has $15.00 + $9.00 = $24.00.

- Lions: 100
- Snakes: 100 / 2 = 50
- Giraffes: 50 - 10 = 40
- Zebras: 2 * 40 = 80
- Elephants: 50 - 5 = 45
- Monkeys: 3 * 40 = 120
- Crocodiles: 100 / 5 = 20
- Flamingos: 40 - 10 = 30

Now, let's calculate the number of each animal in Savanna National Park:

- Lions: 100 * 2 = 200
- Snakes: 50 * 3 = 150
- Giraffes: 40 + 20 = 60
- Zebras: 200 / 2 = 100
- Elephants: 45 + 20 = 65
- Monkeys: 100 - 10 = 90
- Crocodiles: 20 * 2 = 40
- Flamingos: 30 * 3 = 90

Now, let's add up all the animals in Savanna National Park:

200 (lions) + 150 (snakes) + 60 (giraffes) + 100 (zebras) + 65 (elephants) + 90 (monkeys) + 40 (crocodiles) + 90 (flamingos) = 895

He also buys 4 alpacas that cost 25% less each than a llama. He buys 2 zebras that cost twice as much as a goat each. He buys as many ponies as goats, and each pony costs $100 more than a goat. He buys 5 peacocks that cost 50% less each than a pony. He buys 3 kangaroos that cost 20% more each than a zebra. How much did he spend?",13830.0," Let's calculate the cost for each type of animal Tim buys for his zoo.

1. Goats:
He buys 3 goats at $400 each.
Cost of goats = 3 * $400 = $1200

2. Llamas:
He gets twice as many llamas as goats, so he buys 3 * 2 = 6 llamas.
Each llama costs 50% more than a goat, so each llama costs $400 + (50% of $400) = $400 + $200 = $600.
Cost of llamas = 6 * $600 = $3600

3. Alpacas:
He buys 4 alpacas that cost 25% less each than a llama.
25% of $600 (cost of a llama) = 0.25 * $600 = $150.
So, each alpaca costs $600 - $150 = $450.
Cost of alpacas = 4 * $450 = $1800

4. Zebras:
He buys 2 zebras that cost twice as much as a goat each.
Cost of a zebra = 2 * $400 = $800.
Cost of zebras = 2 * $800 = $1600

5. Ponies:
He buys as many ponies as goats, so he buys 3 ponies.
Each pony costs $100 more than a goat, so each pony costs $400 + $100 = $500.
Cost of ponies = 3 * $500 = $1500

6. Peacocks:
He buys 5 peacocks that cost 50% less each than a pony.
50% of $500 (cost of a pony) = 0.5 * $500 = $250.
So, each peacock costs $500 - $250 = $250.
Cost of peacocks = 5 * $250 = $1250

7. Kangaroos:
He buys 3 kangaroos that cost 20% more each than a zebra.
20% of $800 (cost of a zebra) = 0.20 * $800 = $160.
So, each kangaroo costs $800 + $160 = $960.
Cost of kangaroos = 3 * $960 = $2880

Now, let's add up the costs for all the animals to find the total amount Tim spent:
Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of llamas + Cost of alpacas + Cost of zebras + Cost of ponies + Cost of peacocks + Cost of kangaroos
Total cost = $1200 + $3600 + $1800 + $1600 + $1500 + $1250 + $2880
Total cost = $12230

So, Tim spent a total of $12230 on animals for his zoo.

Under optimal wind conditions, the use of two sails brings the ship to the speed of 50 knots, whereas under the same conditions, the use of one sail brings her ship to the speed of 25 knots. A knot is a nautical term for speed equal to 1 nautical mile per hour, and one nautical mile equals 1.15 land miles.

Under the same conditions, the use of four sails brings the ship to the speed of 70 knots, and she sails for 2 hours using four sails. Under the same conditions, sailing with one reefed sail brings her ship to the speed of 15 knots, and she sails for 4 hours with a reefed sail. Under the same conditions, the use of two sails while carrying extra cargo brings her ship to the speed of 40 knots, and she sails for 1 hour using two sails with the extra cargo. Under the same conditions, the use of one sail with a favorable current brings her ship to the speed of 30 knots, and she sails for 2 hours with that setup. what is the total distance, in land miles, that she will travel?",759.0," To calculate the total distance Buffy will travel in land miles, we need to calculate the distance she travels with each setup and then sum them up.

1. One sail for 4 hours at 25 knots:
Distance = Speed × Time = 25 knots × 4 hours = 100 nautical miles

2. Two sails for 4 hours at 50 knots:
Distance = Speed × Time = 50 knots × 4 hours = 200 nautical miles

3. Three sails for 1 hour at 60 knots:
Distance = Speed × Time = 60 knots × 1 hour = 60 nautical miles

4. Four sails for 2 hours at 70 knots:
Distance = Speed × Time = 70 knots × 2 hours = 140 nautical miles

5. One reefed sail for 4 hours at 15 knots:
Distance = Speed × Time = 15 knots × 4 hours = 60 nautical miles

6. Two sails with extra cargo for 1 hour at 40 knots:
Distance = Speed × Time = 40 knots × 1 hour = 40 nautical miles

7. One sail with a favorable current for 2 hours at 30 knots:
Distance = Speed × Time = 30 knots × 2 hours = 60 nautical miles

Now, we convert the total nautical miles to land miles using the conversion factor 1 nautical mile = 1.15 land miles.

Total nautical miles = 100 + 200 + 60 + 140 + 60 + 40 + 60 = 660 nautical miles

Total land miles = Total nautical miles × Conversion factor

1. Mell's order: 2 cups of coffee + 1 piece of cake = 2 * $4 + $7 = $8 + $7 = $15

2. Each of the two friends who ordered the same as Mell but also bought a bowl of ice cream: 2 cups of coffee + 1 piece of cake + 1 bowl of ice cream = 2 * $4 + $7 + $3 = $8 + $7 + $3 = $18

Since there are two such friends, the total cost for them is 2 * $18 = $36

3. Nina's order: 2 cups of coffee + 1 piece of cake + 2 bowls of ice cream = 2 * $4 + $7 + 2 * $3 = $8 + $7 + $6 = $21

4. Each of the two friends who ordered 1 cup of coffee and 2 bowls of ice cream: 1 cup of coffee + 2 bowls of ice cream = $4 + 2 * $3 = $4 + $6 = $10

Since there are two such friends, the total cost for them is 2 * $10 = $20

5. Omar's order: 3 cups of coffee + 1 piece of cake = 3 * $4 + $7 = $12 + $7 = $19

6. Each of the three friends who ordered 1 cup of coffee and 1 piece of cake: 1 cup of coffee + 1 piece of cake = $4 + $7 = $11

Since there are three such friends, the total cost for them is 3 * $11 = $33

7. Ava's order: 4 bowls of ice cream = 4 * $3 = $12

First, let's calculate the cost of women's t-shirts for each color, knowing that they are $5 cheaper than the men's t-shirts of the same color:

- White women's t-shirts: $20 - $5 = $15
- Black women's t-shirts: $18 - $5 = $13
- Blue women's t-shirts: $22 - $5 = $17

- Green women's t-shirts: $19 - $5 = $14
- Gray women's t-shirts: $17 - $5 = $12
- Yellow women's t-shirts: $16 - $5 = $11

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each color, considering there are 10 men and 10 women in each sector, and there are 2 sectors for white and black t-shirts:

- White t-shirts (men + women): (10 * $20) + (10 * $15) = $200 + $150 = $350
- Black t-shirts (men + women): (10 * $18) + (10 * $13) = $180 + $130 = $310
- Blue t-shirts (men + women): (10 * $22) + (10 * $17) = $220 + $170 = $390
- Red t-shirts (men + women): (10 * $21) + (10 * $16) = $210 + $160 = $370
- Green t-shirts (men + women): (10 * $19) + (10 * $14) = $190 + $140 = $330
- Gray t-shirts (men + women): (10 * $17) + (10 * $12) = $170 + $120 = $290

3. Green gumballs: 4 times as many as blue gumballs, so 8 * 4 = 32
4. Yellow gumballs: As many as blue gumballs, so 8
5. Purple gumballs: 3 fewer than red gumballs, so 16 - 3 = 13
6. Orange gumballs: Twice as many as blue gumballs, so 8 * 2 = 16
7. Pink gumballs: One-fourth as many as green gumballs, so 32 / 4 = 8
8. White gumballs: As many as the total number of yellow and blue gumballs combined, so 8 (yellow) + 8 (blue) = 16

Now, let's add up all the gumballs:

Red + Blue + Green + Yellow + Purple + Orange + Pink + White
= 16 + 8 + 32 + 8 + 13 + 16 + 8 + 16
= 118

So, the machine has a total of 118 gumballs.

The final answer is: \boxed{118}",118,118.0,False,
