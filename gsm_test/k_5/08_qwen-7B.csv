How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle, Alice, Bob, David, Zoe and John have together if John has 20 sheep?",65540.0,"Let's start by defining the number of sheep each person has in terms of John's sheep.

1. **John**: Given that John has 20 sheep.
2. **Zoe**: Zoe has 4 times as many sheep as John.
   \[
   \text{Zoe} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]
3. **David**: David has 2 times as many sheep as Zoe.
   \[
   \text{David} = 2 \times 80 = 160

4. **Bob**: Bob has 3 times as many sheep as David.
   \[
   \text{Bob} = 3 \times 160 = 480

5. **Alice**: Alice has 5 times as many sheep as Bob.
   \[
   \text{Alice} = 5 \times 480 = 2400

7. **Charleston**: Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Charleston} = 4 \times 4800 = 19200
   \]
8. **Toulouse**: Toulouse has 2 times as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Toulouse} = 2 \times 19200 = 38400
   \]

Now, we sum up the number of sheep for all individuals:

\[
\text{Total} = \text{Toulouse} + \text{Charleston} + \text{Seattle} + \text{Alice} + \text{Bob} + \text{David} + \text{Zoe} + \text{John}

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total} = 38400 + 19200 + 4800 + 2400 + 480 + 160 + 80 + 20
\]

Adding these together step-by-step:

\[
38400 + 19200 = 57600

\[
57600 + 4800 = 62400

\[
62400 + 2400 = 64800

How much money did he make from selling all the water?,396.0,"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rain collected over the week.
2. Convert the total inches of rain into gallons.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the water.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rain collected over the week.**

- Monday: 4 inches
- Tuesday: 3 inches
- Wednesday: 2 inches
- Thursday: 1 inch
- Friday: 5 inches
- Saturday: 3 inches
- Sunday: 4 inches

Total inches of rain = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 22 inches

**Step 2: Convert the total inches of rain into gallons.**

Given that 1 inch of rain equals 15.0 gallons, we can calculate the total gallons as follows:

Total gallons = Total inches of rain × Gallons per inch
Total gallons = 22 inches × 15.0 gallons/inch
Total gallons = 330 gallons

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the water.**

Given that water is sold for $1.2 per gallon, we can calculate the total revenue as follows:

How much did he spend for the night?,514.65,"Let's break down the expenses step by step:

1. **Entry Fee:**
   - James pays $20 to enter the club.

2. **Drinks:**
   - Drinks cost $6 each.
   - James buys 2 rounds for his 5 friends: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) drinks.
   - He buys 6 drinks for himself.
   - Total drinks: \(10 + 6 = 16\) drinks.
   - Cost of drinks: \(16 \times 6 = 96\) dollars.

3. **Food:**
   - Fried chicken: $14.
   - Nachos: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars.
   - Wings: \(1 \times 12 = 12\) dollars.
   - Wine: \(7 \times 25 = 175\) dollars.
   - Shots: \(9 \times 3.5 = 31.5\) dollars.
   - Dessert platter: \(4 \times 9 = 36\) dollars.
   - Total food cost: \(14 + 16 + 12 + 175 + 31.5 + 36 = 294.5\) dollars.

4. **Total Cost Before Tip:**
   - Entry fee: $20.
   - Drinks: $96.
   - Food: $294.5.
   - Total before tip: \(20 + 96 + 294.5 = 410.5\) dollars.

5. **Tip Calculation:**
   - Tip is 30% of the total cost before tip.
   - Tip amount: \(0.30 \times 410.5 = 123.15\) dollars.

6. **Total Cost Including Tip:**
   - Total cost including tip: \(410.5 + 123.15 = 533.65\) dollars.

The Sunset is 2 times as old as the Crestwood. If the Carlo Rosi is 40 years old, what is the total age of all the listed wines?",490.0,"Let's start by defining the ages of each wine based on the given information.

1. **Carlo Rosi** is given to be 40 years old.
   - \( \text{Carlo Rosi} = 40 \)

2. **Franzia** is three times as old as the Carlo Rosi.
   - \( \text{Franzia} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \)

3. **Twin Valley** is one-fourth the age of the Carlo Rosi.
   - \( \text{Twin Valley} = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \)

4. **Silver Ridge** is the same age as the Franzia.
   - \( \text{Silver Ridge} = 120 \)

5. **Old Vine** is half the age of the Twin Valley.
   - \( \text{Old Vine} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \)

6. **Crestwood** is the same age as the Carlo Rosi.
   - \( \text{Crestwood} = 40 \)

7. **Barrel Hill** is three times as old as the Old Vine.
   - \( \text{Barrel Hill} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \)

8. **Sunset** is twice as old as the Crestwood.
   - \( \text{Sunset} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \)

Now, we sum up the ages of all the wines:

\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Franzia} + \text{Carlo Rosi} + \text{Twin Valley} + \text{Silver Ridge} + \text{Old Vine} + \text{Crestwood} + \text{Barrel Hill} + \text{Sunset}

4. **Thursday**: 65 kilometers
5. **Friday**: 30 kilometers

Next, we need to calculate the distance for Saturday and Sunday:

6. **Saturday**: She rode 50% fewer kilometers than Thursday.
   - 50% of 65 kilometers = \( \frac{50}{100} \times 65 = 32.5 \) kilometers
   - Therefore, 50% fewer kilometers than Thursday = \( 65 - 32.5 = 32.5 \) kilometers

7. **Sunday**: She rode as many kilometers as the sum of the kilometers from Monday and Saturday.

Now, let's calculate the distances for the next two days:

8. **Next Monday**: 60 kilometers
9. **Next Tuesday**: 20% more kilometers than Next Monday.
   - 20% of 60 kilometers = \( \frac{20}{100} \times 60 = 12 \) kilometers
   - Therefore, 20% more kilometers than Next Monday = \( 60 + 12 = 72 \) kilometers

\[ T_W = 30 \]

Next, calculate \( T_J \):
\[ T_W = \frac{1}{2}T_J \]
\[ 30 = \frac{1}{2}T_J \]
\[ T_J = 60 \]

Now, calculate \( B_J \):

First, let's list the animals and their leg counts:

- Chimps: 12 chimps × 2 legs each = 24 legs
- Lions: 8 lions × 4 legs each = 32 legs
- Lizards: 5 lizards × 4 legs each = 20 legs
- Penguins: 8 penguins × 2 legs each = 16 legs
- Elephants: 6 elephants × 4 legs each = 24 legs
- Parrots: 12 parrots × 2 legs each = 24 legs
- Turtles: 4 turtles × 4 legs each = 16 legs

If his farm produced 400 kg of mangoes and he sold the fruits at $50 per kg, calculate the total amount of money he got in that season.",172500.0,"Let's start by defining the variables based on the information given:

- Let \( M \) be the total produce of mangoes.
- Given: \( M = 400 \) kg.

Now, let's find the produce for each type of fruit:

1. **Apples (A):**
   - Total produce of apples was twice the total produce of mangoes.
   - Therefore, \( A = 2M = 2 \times 400 = 800 \) kg.

2. **Oranges (O):**
   - Total produce of oranges was 200 kg more than that of mangoes.
   - Therefore, \( O = M + 200 = 400 + 200 = 600 \) kg.

3. **Bananas (B):**
   - He produced 100 kg fewer bananas than apples.
   - Therefore, \( B = A - 100 = 800 - 100 = 700 \) kg.

4. **Peaches (P):**
   - The total produce of peaches was half the total produce of oranges.
   - Therefore, \( P = \frac{O}{2} = \frac{600}{2} = 300 \) kg.

5. **Guavas (G):**
   - He harvested one-fourth as many guavas as mangoes.
   - Therefore, \( G = \frac{M}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) kg.

6. **Lemons (L):**
   - The total produce of lemons was 50 kg more than the total produce of peaches.
   - Therefore, \( L = P + 50 = 300 + 50 = 350 \) kg.

7. **Plums (Pl):**
   - He produced twice as many plums as guavas.
   - Therefore, \( Pl = 2G = 2 \times 100 = 200 \) kg.

Next, we sum up the total produce of all the fruits:

\[
\text{Total produce} = A + M + O + B + P + G + L + Pl

Substituting the values we found:

\[
\text{Total produce} = 800 + 400 + 600 + 700 + 300 + 100 + 350 + 200 = 3250 \text{ kg}

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money he got by selling the fruits at $50 per kg:

What is the combined length of time, in minutes, that all the entertainers mentioned stand on their back legs?",101.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total time each entertainer stands on their back legs.

1. **Pulsar**: 
   - Time = 10 minutes

2. **Polly**:
   - Time = 3 times Pulsar's time
   - Time = \(3 \times 10 = 30\) minutes

3. **Petra**:
   - Time = \(\frac{1}{6}\) of Polly's time
   - Time = \(\frac{1}{6} \times 30 = 5\) minutes

4. **Marvin**:
   - Time = \(\frac{1}{2}\) of Polly's time
   - Time = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15\) minutes

5. **Zelda**:
   - Time = 4 minutes more than Pulsar's time
   - Time = \(10 + 4 = 14\) minutes

6. **Trixie**:
   - Time = 2 times Petra's time
   - Time = \(2 \times 5 = 10\) minutes

7. **Wally**:
   - Time = \(\frac{1}{3}\) of Marvin's time
   - Time = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5\) minutes

8. **Greta**:
   - Time = 2 minutes less than Zelda's time
   - Time = \(14 - 2 = 12\) minutes

Now, let's sum up all the times:

\[
10 + 30 + 5 + 15 + 14 + 10 + 5 + 12

Adding these together step by step:

\[
10 + 30 = 40

The formula to calculate distance is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

First, let's calculate the distance for each segment of the trip.

1. **One sail for 4 hours:**
   - Speed: 25 knots
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Distance: \( 25 \text{ knots} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 100 \text{ nautical miles} \)

2. **Two sails for 4 hours:**
   - Speed: 50 knots
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Distance: \( 50 \text{ knots} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ nautical miles} \)

3. **Three sails for 1 hour:**
   - Speed: 60 knots
   - Time: 1 hour
   - Distance: \( 60 \text{ knots} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ nautical miles} \)

4. **Four sails for 2 hours:**
   - Speed: 70 knots
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance: \( 70 \text{ knots} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ nautical miles} \)

5. **One reefed sail for 4 hours:**
   - Speed: 15 knots
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Distance: \( 15 \text{ knots} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ nautical miles} \)

6. **Two sails with extra cargo for 1 hour:**
   - Speed: 40 knots
   - Time: 1 hour
   - Distance: \( 40 \text{ knots} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 40 \text{ nautical miles} \)

7. **One sail with a favorable current for 2 hours:**
   - Speed: 30 knots
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance: \( 30 \text{ knots} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ nautical miles} \)

Now, let's sum up all the distances in nautical miles:

\[ 100 + 200 + 60 + 140 + 60 + 40 + 60 = 660 \text{ nautical miles} \]

Finally, convert the total distance from nautical miles to land miles:

Another friend, Tina, loves lasagna and will eat 3 pieces. Another friend, Omar, will eat half as much as Kai. Another friend, Zoe, will eat one more piece of lasagna than Manny. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",15.0,"Let's break down the lasagna consumption step by step:

1. **Manny**: 1 piece
2. **Aaron**: 0 pieces (only eats garlic bread and salad)
3. **Kai**: 2 pieces (twice as much as Manny)
4. **Raphael**: 0.5 pieces (half the amount Manny does)
5. **Lisa**: 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 pieces (two pieces plus any leftover from Raphael)
6. **Nora**: \(\frac{1}{3}\) piece (one-third of what Manny eats)
7. **Ben**: 2 pieces (same as Kai)
8. **Tina**: 3 pieces
9. **Omar**: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1\) piece (half as much as Kai)

- Raphael: 0.5
- Lisa: 2.5
- Nora: \(\frac{1}{3}\)

- Omar: 1
- Zoe: 2

Adding these together:

\[ 1 + 0 + 2 + 0.5 + 2.5 + \frac{1}{3} + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 \]

First, add the whole numbers:

\[ 1 + 2 + 0.5 + 2.5 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 14 \]

Next, add the fraction:

\[ 14 + \frac{1}{3} \]

To combine this, convert 14 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:

\[ 14 = \frac{42}{3} \]

So,

\[ \frac{42}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{43}{3} \]

Convert \(\frac{43}{3}\) to a mixed number:

\[ \frac{43}{3} = 14 \frac{1}{3} \]

Since we need to cut the lasagna into whole pieces, we round up to the nearest whole number because you can't serve a fraction of a piece.

Therefore, Manny should cut the lasagna into 15 pieces.

   - Scorpions have 8 legs each.
   - Monroe has 3 scorpions.
   - Total legs from scorpions = \(3 \times 8 = 24\).

5. **Crickets:**
   - Crickets have 6 legs each.
   - Monroe has 10 crickets.
   - Total legs from crickets = \(10 \times 6 = 60\).

6. **Crabs:**
   - Crabs have 10 legs each.
   - Monroe has 2 crabs.
   - Total legs from crabs = \(2 \times 10 = 20\).

7. **Ladybugs:**
   - Ladybugs have 6 legs each.
   - Monroe has 7 ladybugs.
   - Total legs from ladybugs = \(7 \times 6 = 42\).

Now, we sum all the legs:

\[64 + 72 + 30 + 24 + 60 + 20 + 42 = 302\]

The machine has as many white gumballs as the total number of yellow and blue gumballs combined. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",117.0,"Let's start by defining the variables based on the information given:

- Let \( R \) be the number of red gumballs.
- Let \( B \) be the number of blue gumballs.
- Let \( G \) be the number of green gumballs.
- Let \( Y \) be the number of yellow gumballs.
- Let \( P \) be the number of purple gumballs.
- Let \( O \) be the number of orange gumballs.
- Let \( K \) be the number of pink gumballs.
- Let \( W \) be the number of white gumballs.

We are given that the machine has 16 red gumballs:
\[ R = 16 \]

From the problem statement, we can derive the following relationships:

1. The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs:
\[ B = \frac{R}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

2. For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs:
\[ G = 4B = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

3. The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs:
\[ Y = B = 8 \]

4. The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs:
\[ P = R - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

5. The machine has twice as many orange gumballs as blue gumballs:
\[ O = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

6. The machine has one-fourth as many pink gumballs as green gumballs:
\[ K = \frac{G}{4} = \frac{32}{4} = 8 \]

7. The machine has as many white gumballs as the total number of yellow and blue gumballs combined:
\[ W = Y + B = 8 + 8 = 16 \]

Now, let's sum up all the gumballs to find the total number of gumballs in the machine:
\[ \text{Total} = R + B + G + Y + P + O + K + W \]
\[ \text{Total} = 16 + 8 + 32 + 8 + 13 + 16 + 8 + 16 \]
\[ \text{Total} = 115 \]
