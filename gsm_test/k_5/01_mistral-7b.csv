Alice has 5 times as many sheep as Bob. Bob has 3 times as many sheep as David. David has 2 times as many sheep as Zoe. Zoe has 4 times as many sheep as John. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle, Alice, Bob, David, Zoe and John have together if John has 20 sheep?",65540.0,"Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of sheep in each city as follows: T = Toulouse, C = Charleston, S = Seattle, A = Alice, B = Bob, D = David, Z = Zoe, and J = John.

2. From the problem, we have the following relationships:
   - T = 2C
   - C = 4S
   - S = 2A
   - A = 5B
   - B = 3D
   - D = 2Z
   - Z = 4J

3. We know that J = 20, so Z = 4 * 20 = 80.

4. Since D = 2Z, D = 2 * 80 = 160.

5. Since B = 3D, B = 3 * 160 = 480.

6. Since A = 5B, A = 5 * 480 = 2400.

7. Since S = 2A, S = 2 * 2400 = 4800.

8. Since C = 4S, C = 4 * 4800 = 19,200.

9. Finally, since T = 2C, T = 2 * 19,200 = 38,400.

10. So, Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle, Alice, Bob, David, Zoe, and John together have 38,400 (Toulouse) + 19,200 (Charleston) + 4800 (Seattle) + 2400 (Alice) + 480 (Bob) + 160 (David) + 80 (Zoe) + 20 (John) = 65,810 sheep.

1. Red candies: Maria said there were 40 red candies.

2. Yellow candies: There are three times as many yellow candies as red candies, so there are 3 * 40 = 120 yellow candies. Since Carlos ate all of them, we'll subtract 120 from the total number of candies.

3. Blue candies: There are half as many blue candies as yellow candies, so there are 120 / 2 = 60 blue candies.

4. Green candies: There are half as many green candies as red candies, so there are 40 * 0.5 = 20 green candies.

5. Purple candies: There are five times as many purple candies as yellow candies, so there are 120 * 5 - 10 = 610 - 10 = 600 purple candies.

6. Orange candies: There are one-fifth as many orange candies as yellow candies, so there are 120 / 5 = 24 orange candies.

1. Let's denote the age of Twin Valley as TV.
2. The Franzia is three times as old as the Twin Valley, so Franzia = 3 * TV.
3. The Carlo Rosi is four times as old as the Twin Valley, so Carlo Rosi = 4 * TV.
4. Since the Silver Ridge is the same age as the Franzia, Silver Ridge = Franzia = 3 * TV.
5. The Old Vine is 2 times as old as the Twin Valley, so Old Vine = 2 * TV.
6. The Barrel Hill is 3 times as old as the Old Vine, so Barrel Hill = 3 * (2 * TV) = 6 * TV.

8. The Sunset is 2 times as old as the Crestwood, so Sunset = 2 * Crestwood = 2 * (4 * TV) = 8 * TV.

Now we know the ages of all the wines in terms of TV. We are given that Carlo Rosi is 40 years old, so TV = 40 / 4 = 10.

2. We know that A + R = A + 34 (since there are 34 more rabbits than antelopes).

3. We also know that A + R + H = 2A + R + 42 (since there are 42 fewer hyenas than the total number of antelopes and rabbits combined).

4. Furthermore, W = H + 50 (since there are 50 more wild dogs than hyenas).

5. L = (1/2)R (since the number of leopards is half the number of rabbits).

6. Z = 2L + 3 (since there are twice as many zebras as leopards, and 3 fewer giraffes than zebras).

7. B = A + R (since there are half as many buffaloes as antelopes and rabbits combined).

8. M = (1/3)(R + L) (since there are two-thirds as many monkeys as rabbits and leopards combined).

9. We also know that W + H = 2(A + W) - 5 (since there are 5 more elephants than the total number of wild dogs and hyenas combined).

10. Now we have 9 equations with 9 variables. We can solve this system of equations to find the values of A, R, H, W, L, Z, B, M, and the total number of animals.

11. After solving the system, we find that A + R + H + W + L + Z + B + M = 282.

So, the total number of animals that Josie counted is 282.",282,282.0,False,

1. Necklaces: The necklace stand can hold 12 necklaces, but currently holds 5. So, we need 12 - 5 = 7 more necklaces. The cost for these would be 7 * $4 = $28.

2. Rings: The ring display can hold 30 rings, but currently holds 18. So, we need 30 - 18 = 12 more rings. The cost for these would be 12 * $10 = $120.

3. Bracelets: The bracelet display can hold 15 bracelets, but currently holds 8. So, we need 15 - 8 = 7 more bracelets. The cost for these would be 7 * $5 = $35.

1. Jenny collected 30 red marbles. Let's denote the number of red marbles collected by Mary as M, Anie as A, Tom as T, and Maya as Y. So, Mary collected M = 2 * Jenny = 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles, Anie collected A = 20 + M = 20 + 60 = 80 red marbles, Tom collected T = 3 * Jenny = 3 * 30 = 90 red marbles, and Maya collected Y = 5 * Tom = 5 * 90 = 450 red marbles.

2. Jenny collected 25 blue marbles. Mary collected half of Anie's blue marbles, so Mary collected B_M = 0.5 * (A - 20) blue marbles. Anie collected B_A = 25 + B_M blue marbles. Tom collected B_T = 5 * B_M blue marbles. Maya collected B_Y = 3 * B_A blue marbles. Ivy collected B_I = 3 * B_M blue marbles.

3. We know that Ivy collected 2 fewer blue marbles than Leo, so Leo collected B_L = B_I + 2 blue marbles.

4. We also know that Sara collected 10 fewer red marbles than Anie, so Sara collected R_S = A - 10 red marbles. Sara collected 5 times as many blue marbles as Mary, so Sara collected B_S = 5 * B_M blue marbles.

5. We know that Leo collected three times as many red marbles as Jenny, so Leo collected R_L = 3 * Jenny = 3 * 30 = 90 red marbles. Since Leo collected 3 times as many blue marbles as Jenny, Leo collected B_L = 3 * B_J = 3 * 25 = 75 blue marbles.

6. We know that Ivy collected three times as many blue marbles as Mary, so Ivy collected B_I = 3 * B_M blue marbles. Since Ivy collected 2 fewer blue marbles than Leo, we can find B_M by solving the equation B_M + 2 = B_I = 3 * B_M, which gives B_M = 10 blue marbles.

Orange soda: 2 * 15 = 30 oz

Total volume = 72 + 28 + 40 + 40 + 30 + 20 + 30 + 20 = 260 oz

Since there are 16 ounces in a quart, we can convert the total volume to quarts:

1. Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats. Let's denote the number of treats Jane brings as T_J. Then, the number of pieces of bread Jane brings is 0.75 * T_J.

2. Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane, so Wanda brings 0.5 * T_J treats. Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, so the number of treats Wanda brings is T_W = 90 / 3 = 30.

3. Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, so the number of pieces of bread Wanda brings is 3 * T_W = 3 * 30 = 90.

4. Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda, so Mia brings T_M = T_W - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 treats. Mia brings half as many pieces of bread as treats, so the number of pieces of bread Mia brings is 0.5 * T_M = 0.5 * 20 = 10.

5. Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda, so Omar brings T_O = 1.5 * T_W = 1.5 * 30 = 45 treats. Omar brings four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats, so the number of pieces of bread Omar brings is 0.8 * T_O = 0.8 * 45 = 36.

6. Priya brings twice as many treats as Carlos, so Priya brings T_P = 2 * T_C. We don't have the number of treats Carlos brings yet, so we'll leave this for now. Priya brings one-fourth as many pieces of bread as treats, so the number of pieces of bread Priya brings is 0.25 * T_P.

7. Elena brings 5 more treats than Mia, so Elena brings T_E = T_M + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 treats. Elena brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, so the number of pieces of bread Elena brings is 3 * T_E = 3 * 25 = 75.

Now, let's find the number of treats Carlos brings. Since Priya brings twice as many treats as Carlos, we have T_C = T_P / 2. Substituting this into the equation for Priya's treats, we get T_P = 2 * T_C. Solving for T_C, we find T_C = T_P / 2.

Now we have the number of treats for everyone:

   - Oranges: Twice as many as apples today, so O_t = 2 * A_t = 2 * 7 = 14
   - Pears: 2 fewer than the number of apples today, so P_t = A_t - 2 = 7 - 2 = 5
   - Peaches: Three times as many as last night, so P_t = 3 * 3 = 9

Processing fee = $500 (one-time)

Next, let's calculate the joining fee for each family member:

Joining fee per person = $4000
Total joining fee for family = 4 (family members) * $4000 = $16000

Now, let's calculate the annual maintenance fee for each family member:

Annual maintenance fee per person = $600
Total annual maintenance fee for family = 4 (family members) * $600 = $2400

Next, let's calculate the monthly cost for each family member:

Monthly cost per person = $1000 + $50 (gym access) = $1050
Total monthly cost for family = 4 (family members) * $1050 = $4200

Now, let's calculate the cost of guest passes per month:

Guest passes cost per month = 2 (guest passes) * 2 (family members using passes) * $30 (cost per pass) = $1200

Next, let's calculate the cost of locker rentals for 3 members:

Locker rental cost per year = 3 (members) * $120 (locker rental per member) = $360

Now, let's calculate the total annual cost for the family:

Total annual cost = Joining fee + Annual maintenance fee + Monthly cost * 12 (months) + Guest passes cost * 12 (months) + Locker rental cost + Processing fee
Total annual cost = $16000 + $2400 + ($4200 * 12) + ($1200 * 12) + $360 + $500 = $112,480

1. Goats: 3 * $400 = $1200
2. Llamas: Number of llamas = 2 * Number of goats = 2 * 3 = 6. Cost of each llama = 1.5 * Cost of a goat = 1.5 * $400 = $600. Total cost for llamas = 6 * $600 = $3600
3. Alpacas: Cost of each alpaca = 0.75 * Cost of a llama = 0.75 * $600 = $450. Total cost for alpacas = 4 * $450 = $1800
4. Zebras: Cost of each zebra = 2 * Cost of a goat = 2 * $400 = $800. Total cost for zebras = 2 * $800 = $1600
5. Ponies: Number of ponies = Number of goats = 3. Cost of each pony = $100 more than a goat = $400 + $100 = $500. Total cost for ponies = 3 * $500 = $1500
6. Peacocks: Cost of each peacock = 0.5 * Cost of a pony = 0.5 * $500 = $250. Total cost for peacocks = 5 * $250 = $1250
7. Kangaroos: Cost of each kangaroo = 1.2 * Cost of a zebra = 1.2 * $800 = $960. Total cost for kangaroos = 3 * $960 = $2880

Since 1 knot equals 1.15 land miles per hour, we can convert the speeds as follows:

1. One sail: 25 knots * 1.15 = 28.75 miles per hour
2. Two sails: 50 knots * 1.15 = 57.5 miles per hour
3. Three sails: 60 knots * 1.15 = 69 miles per hour

How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",15.0,"Let's break down the amounts of lasagna each person will eat:

1. Manny: 1 piece (since he only wants one)
2. Aaron: 0 pieces (he won't eat lasagna)
3. Kai: 2 * Manny's pieces (since he eats twice as much as Manny)
4. Raphael: 0.5 * Manny's pieces (since he eats half the amount Manny does)
5. Lisa (from her own piece): 2 pieces
6. Lisa (from Raphael's leftovers): Raphael's leftovers = Manny's pieces - Raphael's pieces = Manny's pieces - 0.5 * Manny's pieces = 0.5 * Manny's pieces

Total Lasagna = 10.5 * Manny's pieces + 3 pieces

Since Manny needs to cut the lasagna into a whole number of pieces, we can't have a fraction of a piece. So, we'll round up the total Lasagna to the nearest whole number:

Total Lasagna = 11 * Manny's pieces + 3

To find Manny's pieces, we'll divide the total Lasagna by the number of pieces needed for all the guests:

Manny's pieces = Total Lasagna / (Number of guests)
Manny's pieces = (11 * Manny's pieces + 3) / (12 + 1)
Manny's pieces = (11 * Manny's pieces + 3) / 13

How much did he spend total on buying t-shirts?",2310.0,"First, let's find the cost for men's t-shirts of each color. Since white and black t-shirts cost $20 and $18 respectively, we can assume that other colors are $19 (the highest cost among them).

Cost for white men's t-shirts: $20
Cost for black men's t-shirts: $18
Cost for blue, red, green, gray, and yellow men's t-shirts: $19 (since they all cost the same)

Since there are 10 men in each sector and 5 sectors use these colors, the total cost for men's t-shirts is:

(10 men/sector * 5 sectors * $20/shirt) + (10 men/sector * 5 sectors * $18/shirt) + (5 sectors * 10 men/sector * $19/shirt) = $1000 + $900 + $950 = $2850

Now, let's find the cost for women's t-shirts. Since women's t-shirts are $5 cheaper than men's t-shirts of the same color, the cost for women's t-shirts of each color is $14 ($19 - $5).

Cost for white women's t-shirts: $14
Cost for black women's t-shirts: $14
Cost for blue, red, green, gray, and yellow women's t-shirts: $14 (since they all cost the same)

Since there are 10 women in each sector and 5 sectors use these colors, the total cost for women's t-shirts is:

(10 women/sector * 5 sectors * $14/shirt) = $700

Now, let's find the total number of employees. There are 140 employees in total (10 men + 10 women in each of the 7 sectors).

Finally, let's find the total amount spent on t-shirts:

Total amount spent = (Cost for men's t-shirts) + (Cost for women's t-shirts) - (2 sectors * 10 men/sector * $5/shirt) (since these sectors use white and black t-shirts, and women's t-shirts are $5 cheaper than men's t-shirts of the same color)
