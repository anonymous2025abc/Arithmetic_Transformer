Ivy collected three times as many blue marbles as Mary. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?",517.0,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

**1. Calculate Mary's collections:**

* Red marbles: Jenny collected 30 red marbles, and Mary collected twice that amount, so Mary collected 30 * 2 = 60 red marbles.
* Blue marbles: Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary, meaning Anie collected 60 + 20 = 80 red marbles. Anie also collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, so Anie collected 25 * 2 = 50 blue marbles. Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, so Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles.

**2. Calculate Tom's collections:**

* Red marbles: Tom collected three times as many red marbles as Mary, so Tom collected 60 * 3 = 180 red marbles.
* Blue marbles: Tom collected 5 fewer blue marbles than Jenny, so Tom collected 25 - 5 = 20 blue marbles.

**3. Calculate Sara's collections:**

* Red marbles: Sara collected 10 fewer red marbles than Anie, so Sara collected 80 - 10 = 70 red marbles.
* Blue marbles: Sara collected five times as many blue marbles as Mary, so Sara collected 25 * 5 = 125 blue marbles.

**4. Calculate Leo's collections:**

* Red marbles: Leo collected three times as many red marbles as Jenny, so Leo collected 30 * 3 = 90 red marbles.
* Blue marbles: Leo collected three times as many blue marbles as Jenny, so Leo collected 25 * 3 = 75 blue marbles.

**5. Calculate Maya's collections:**

* Red marbles: Maya collected five times as many red marbles as Tom, so Maya collected 180 * 5 = 900 red marbles.
* Blue marbles: Maya collected 3 fewer blue marbles than Sara, so Maya collected 125 - 3 = 122 blue marbles.

**6. Calculate Ivy's collections:**

* Red marbles: Ivy collected 2 fewer red marbles than Leo, so Ivy collected 90 - 2 = 88 red marbles.
* Blue marbles: Ivy collected three times as many blue marbles as Mary, so Ivy collected 25 * 3 = 75 blue marbles.

How many kilometers did Natalia ride in total?,447.0,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Saturday's ride:** Natalia rode 50% fewer kilometers on Saturday than Thursday, so she rode 65 * 0.50 = 32.5 kilometers.

2. **Sunday's ride:** She rode the sum of Monday's and Saturday's distances on Sunday, so she rode 40 + 32.5 = 72.5 kilometers.

3. **Next Tuesday's ride:** She rode 20% more kilometers on Next Tuesday than Next Monday, so she rode 60 * 0.20 = 12 more kilometers. This means she rode 60 + 12 = 72 kilometers.

**1. Calculate the number of treats each person brought:**

* **Jane:**  We know Wanda brought 90 pieces of bread, and Jane brings 75% as many treats as bread. So Jane brought 0.75 * 90 = 67.5 treats.
* **Wanda:** Wanda brought 90 pieces of bread.
* **Carlos:** Carlos brought 1/3 as many treats as Jane, so he brought 67.5 / 3 = 22.5 treats.
* **Mia:** Mia brought 10 fewer treats than Wanda, so she brought 90 - 10 = 80 treats.
* **Omar:** Omar brought 1.5 times as many treats as Wanda, so he brought 1.5 * 90 = 135 treats.
* **Priya:** Priya brought twice as many treats as Carlos, so she brought 22.5 * 2 = 45 treats.

* **Carlos:** Carlos brought three times as many pieces of bread as treats, so he brought 22.5 * 3 = 67.5 pieces of bread.
* **Mia:** Mia brought half as many pieces of bread as treats, so she brought 80 / 2 = 40 pieces of bread.

If his farm produced 400 kg of mangoes and he sold the fruits at $50 per kg, calculate the total amount of money he got in that season.",172500.0,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Apples:** Mr. Sergio produced twice the amount of apples as mangoes, so he produced 2 * 400 kg = 800 kg of apples.

2. **Oranges:** He produced 200 kg more oranges than mangoes, so he produced 400 kg + 200 kg = 600 kg of oranges.

3. **Bananas:** He produced 100 kg fewer bananas than apples, so he produced 800 kg - 100 kg = 700 kg of bananas.

4. **Peaches:** He harvested half the amount of peaches as oranges, so he produced 600 kg / 2 = 300 kg of peaches.

5. **Guavas:** He harvested one-fourth the amount of guavas as mangoes, so he produced 400 kg / 4 = 100 kg of guavas.

6. **Lemons:** He produced 50 kg more lemons than peaches, so he produced 300 kg + 50 kg = 350 kg of lemons.

7. **Plums:** He produced twice as many plums as guavas, so he produced 100 kg * 2 = 200 kg of plums.

8. **Total Produce:**  To find the total produce, add up all the fruits: 800 kg + 400 kg + 600 kg + 700 kg + 300 kg + 100 kg + 350 kg + 200 kg = 3450 kg

**2. Calculate the cost of t-shirts for each sector:**

* White sector: (20 * $20) + (20 * $15) = $400 + $300 = $700
* Black sector: (20 * $18) + (20 * $13) = $360 + $260 = $620
* Blue sector: (20 * $22) + (20 * $17) = $440 + $340 = $780
* Red sector: (20 * $21) + (20 * $16) = $420 + $320 = $740
* Green sector: (20 * $19) + (20 * $14) = $380 + $280 = $660
* Gray sector: (20 * $17) + (20 * $12) = $340 + $240 = $580
* Yellow sector: (20 * $16) + (20 * $11) = $320 + $220 = $540

**3. Calculate the total cost:**

* Total cost: $700 + $620 + $780 + $740 + $660 + $580 + $540 = **$5620**
