How many items does each baggie have?",34.0,"16 pretzels, 32 goldfish, 16 suckers, 16 granola bars, 8 fruit snacks, 32 crackers, 32 cookies, 8 carrots

Step-by-step explanation:
Let's start with the pretzels. We know that there are 64 pretzels, and we need to divide them into 16 bags. So, each bag will have 4 pretzels.

Next, we have the goldfish. We know that there are four times as many goldfish as pretzels, so there are 256 goldfish. We need to divide them into 16 bags, so each bag will have 16 goldfish.

The suckers are next. We know that there are 32 suckers, and we need to divide them into 16 bags. So, each bag will have 2 suckers.

The granola bars are next. We know that there are 32 granola bars, and we need to divide them into 16 bags. So, each bag will have 2 granola bars.

The fruit snacks are next. We know that there are 16 fruit snacks, and we need to divide them into 16 bags. So, each bag will have 1 fruit snack.

The crackers are next. We know that there are 32 crackers, and we need to divide them into 16 bags. So, each bag will have 2 crackers.

The cookies are next. We know that there are twice as many cookies as granola bars, so there are 64 cookies. We need to divide them into 16 bags, so each bag will have 4 cookies.

The carrots are last. We know that there are three times as many carrots as fruit snacks, so there are 48 carrots. We need to divide them into 16 bags, so each bag will have 3 carrots.

So, the answer is that each bag will have 16 pretzels, 32 goldfish, 16 suckers, 16 granola bars, 8 fruit snacks, 32 crackers, 32 cookies, and 8 carrots.",8,8.0,False,

Ed found 7 limpet shells, 2 oyster shells, and 4 conch shells. Jacob found 2 more shells than Ed did. Maya found 12 fewer than Jacob. Liam found 2 more than Maya. Noah found 3 fewer than Liam. Ava found 2 more than Noah. Sophia found 2 more than Ava. How many shells do they have altogether?",50.0,"0

We'll use the following variables to represent the number of shells each person found:

• Ed: $e$
• Jacob: $j$
• Maya: $m$
• Liam: $l$
• Noah: $n$
• Ava: $a$
• Sophia: $s$

We know that Ed found 7 limpet shells, 2 oyster shells, and 4 conch shells. So, we can write the following equation to represent the number of shells Ed found:

$e = 7 + 2 + 4 = 13$

We know that Jacob found 2 more shells than Ed did. So, we can write the following equation to represent the number of shells Jacob found:

$j = e + 2 = 13 + 2 = 15$

We know that Maya found 12 fewer shells than Jacob did. So, we can write the following equation to represent the number of shells Maya found:

$m = j - 12 = 15 - 12 = 3$

We know that Liam found 2 more shells than Maya did. So, we can write the following equation to represent the number of shells Liam found:

$l = m + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5$

We know that Noah found 3 fewer shells than Liam did. So, we can write the following equation to represent the number of shells Noah found:

$n = l - 3 = 5 - 3 = 2$

We know that Ava found 2 more shells than Noah did. So, we can write the following equation to represent the number of shells Ava found:

$a = n + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4$

We know that Sophia found 2 more shells than Ava did. So, we can write the following equation to represent the number of shells Sophia found:

$s = a + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6$

Now, we can add all of the equations together to find the total number of shells they found:

$e + j + m + l + n + a + s = 13 + 15 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 + 6 = 48$

Priya visited 1 less than three times as many rehabilitation centers as Han did. Chen visited twice as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa did. Nia visited 4 fewer than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jane did. Luis visited 5 more than half as many rehabilitation centers as Nia did. If Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers, how many rehabilitation centers did they all visit in total, assuming they are all different?",97.0,"0

Explanation:

Let's start by assigning variables to the number of rehabilitation centers each person visited. We'll use the following variables:

J = Jane
H = Han
J = Jude
L = Lisa
O = Omar
P = Priya
C = Chen
N = Nia
L = Luis

We can then write the following equations:

J = 6 + 2H
H = 2J - 2
J = 0.5L
O = J + 3
P = 3H - 1
C = 2L
N = 2J - 4
L = 0.5N + 5

We can then solve for the number of rehabilitation centers each person visited. We'll start by solving for H:

H = 2J - 2
H = 2(6 + 2H) - 2
H = 12 + 4H - 2
H = 10 + 4H
4H - 10 = 0
4H = 10
H = 2.5

We can then solve for J:

J = 6 + 2H
J = 6 + 2(2.5)
J = 6 + 5
J = 11

We can then solve for L:

L = 0.5J
L = 0.5(11)
L = 5.5

We can then solve for O:

O = J + 3
O = 11 + 3
O = 14

We can then solve for P:

P = 3H - 1
P = 3(2.5) - 1
P = 7.5 - 1
P = 6.5

We can then solve for C:

C = 2L
C = 2(5.5)
C = 11

We can then solve for N:

N = 2J - 4
N = 2(11) - 4
N = 22 - 4
N = 18

We can then solve for L:

L = 0.5N + 5
L = 0.5(18) + 5
L = 9 + 5
L = 14

We can then solve for the total number of rehabilitation centers they all visited:

Total = J + H + J + L + O + P + C + N + L
Total = 11 + 2.5 + 11 + 5.5 + 14 + 6.5 + 11 + 18 + 14
Total = 83.5

Explanation:
Borgnine wants to see 1100 legs at the zoo. He has already seen 12 chimps, 8 lions, and 5 lizards. He also saw 8 penguins. He also saw 6 elephants. He also saw 12 parrots. He also saw 4 turtles. He also saw 3 scorpions. He is next headed to see the tarantulas. How many tarantulas does he need to see to meet his goal?

The number of legs of each animal is as follows:

Chimps: 4 legs
Lions: 4 legs
Lizards: 4 legs
Penguins: 2 legs
Elephants: 4 legs
Parrots: 2 legs
Turtles: 4 legs
Scorpions: 8 legs
Tarantulas: 8 legs

The total number of legs Borgnine has seen is:

12 chimps + 8 lions + 5 lizards + 8 penguins + 6 elephants + 12 parrots + 4 turtles + 3 scorpions = 58 legs

The number of legs Borgnine needs to see is:

1100 - 58 = 1042 legs

The number of tarantulas Borgnine needs to see is:

1042 / 8 = 130 tarantulas

Therefore, Borgnine needs to see 130 tarantulas to meet his goal.",130,130.0,False,

Explanation:
Let the total produce of mangoes be x kg.
Then, the total produce of apples = 2x kg
The total produce of oranges = x + 200 kg
The total produce of bananas = 2x – 100 kg
The total produce of peaches = x + 200/2 = x + 100 kg
The total produce of guavas = x/4 kg
The total produce of lemons = x + 100 + 50 = x + 150 kg
The total produce of plums = 2x/4 = x/2 kg

He buys 5 peacocks that cost 50% less each than a pony. He buys 3 kangaroos that cost 20% more each than a zebra. How much did he spend?",13830.0,"1,500

Explanation:
Tim buys 3 goats for $400 each, so he spends $1,200 on goats.
He gets twice as many llamas which cost 50% more each, so he spends $1,200 + 1,200 + 1,200 + 1,200 + 1,200 = $6,000 on llamas.
He also buys 4 alpacas that cost 25% less each than a llama, so he spends $6,000 - 4(6,000/4) = $6,000 - $4,500 = $1,500 on alpacas.
He buys 2 zebras that cost twice as much as a goat each, so he spends $2(1,200) = $2,400 on zebras.
He buys as many ponies as goats, and each pony costs $100 more than a goat, so he spends $1,200 + 1,200 + 1,200 + 1,200 + 1,200 = $6,000 on ponies.
He buys 5 peacocks that cost 50% less each than a pony, so he spends $6,000 - 5(6,000/5) = $6,000 - $6,000 = $0 on peacocks.
He buys 3 kangaroos that cost 20% more each than a zebra, so he spends $2,400 + 3(2,400/3) = $2,400 + $2,400 = $4,800 on kangaroos.

Explanation:
Peter's total money is $500.
Peter bought 6 kilos of potatoes for $2 per kilo, 9 kilos of tomato for $3 per kilo, 5 kilos of cucumbers for $4 per kilo, and 3 kilos of bananas for $5 per kilo.
Peter also bought 4 kilos of rice for $6 per kilo, 2 kilos of onions for $3 per kilo, 5 kilos of apples for $4 per kilo, 3 kilos of chicken for $8 per kilo, 10 loaves of bread for $2 each.
Peter's total cost is:
6 kilos of potatoes for $2 per kilo = 6 x 2 = $12
9 kilos of tomato for $3 per kilo = 9 x 3 = $27
5 kilos of cucumbers for $4 per kilo = 5 x 4 = $20
3 kilos of bananas for $5 per kilo = 3 x 5 = $15
4 kilos of rice for $6 per kilo = 4 x 6 = $24
2 kilos of onions for $3 per kilo = 2 x 3 = $6
5 kilos of apples for $4 per kilo = 5 x 4 = $20
3 kilos of chicken for $8 per kilo = 3 x 8 = $24
10 loaves of bread for $2 each = 10 x 2 = $20
