Alice has 5 times as many sheep as Bob. Bob has 3 times as many sheep as David. David has 2 times as many sheep as Zoe. Zoe has 4 times as many sheep as John. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle, Alice, Bob, David, Zoe and John have together if John has 20 sheep?",65540.0,"To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from John's number of sheep to find out how many sheep each person has.

1. **John**: We know that John has 20 sheep.
   \[
   \text{Sheep for John} = 20
   \]

2. **David**: Since David has 2 times as many sheep as Zoe, we can calculate the number of sheep David has using John's number of sheep.
   \[
   \text{Sheep for David} = \frac{\text{Sheep for John}}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

3. **Zoe**: Zoe has 4 times as many sheep as John.
   \[
   \text{Sheep for Zoe} = 4 \times \text{Sheep for John} = 4 \times 20 = 80
   \]

4. **Bob**: Bob has 3 times as many sheep as David.
   \[
   \text{Sheep for Bob} = \frac{\text{Sheep for David}}{3} = \frac{10}{3}
   \]
   However, since the number of sheep must be an integer, there seems to be a mistake here. Let's recheck the previous steps. The correct calculation should be:
   \[
   \text{Sheep for Bob} = \frac{\text{Sheep for David}}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33
   \]
   This indicates a possible error in the initial conditions or calculations. Given the constraints, let's assume the problem meant to say ""Alice"" instead of ""Bob"". If so, then:
   \[
   \text{Sheep for Alice} = 3 \times \text{Sheep for Bob} = 3 \times \frac{10}{3} = 10
   \]

5. **Alice**: Alice has 5 times as many sheep as Bob (or David).
   \[
   \text{Sheep for Alice} = 5 \times \text{Sheep for Bob} = 5 \times \frac{10}{3} = \frac{50}{3} \approx 16.67
   \]
   Again, assuming the problem meant to say ""Alice"", the correct calculation is:
   \[
   \text{Sheep for Alice} = 5 \times \text{Sheep for Bob} = 5 \times \frac{10}{3} = \frac{50}{3} \approx 16.67
   \]

6. **Seattle**: Seattle has 2 times as many sheep as Alice.
   \[
   \text{Sheep for Seattle} = 2 \times \text{Sheep for Alice} = 2 \times \frac{50}{3} = \frac{100}{3} \approx 33.33
   \]

7. **Charleston**: Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
   \[
   \text{Sheep for Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Sheep for Seattle} = 4 \times \frac{100}{3} = \frac{400}{3} \approx 133.33
   \]

8. **Toulouse**: Toulouse has 2 times as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Sheep for Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Sheep for Charleston} = 2 \times \frac{400}{3} = \frac{800}{3} \approx 266.67
   \]

Now, summing up all the sheep:
\[
\text{Total Sheep} = \text{Sheep for Toulouse} + \text{Sheep for Charleston} + \text{Sheep for Seattle} + \text{Sheep for Alice} + \text{Sheep for Bob} + \text{Sheep for David} + \text{Sheep for Zoe} + \text{Sheep for John}
\]
\[
\text{Total Sheep} = \frac{800}{3} + \frac{400}{3} + \frac{100}{3} + \frac{50}{3} + \frac{10}{3} + \frac{10}{3} + \frac{80}{3} + 20
\]
\[
\text{Total Sheep} = \frac{800 + 400 + 100 + 50 + 10 + 10 + 80}{3} + 20
\]
\[
\text{Total Sheep} = \frac{1490}{3} + 20
\]
\[
\text{Total Sheep} = 496.67 + 20
\]
\[
\text{Total Sheep} = 516.67

1. Calculate the total amount of rain that fell during the week.
2. Convert the total rainfall into gallons.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rain that fell during the week.**

The rainfall amounts for each day are as follows:
- Monday: 4 inches
- Tuesday: 3 inches
- Wednesday: 2 inches
- Thursday: 1 inch
- Friday: 5 inches
- Saturday: 3 inches

She also spends 1 minutes warm-up, 2 minutes costume changes, 1 minutes interviews, 3 minutes meet-and-greet, and 2 minutes vocal coaching for each minute singing. If her final stage performance is 6 minutes long, what is the total combined amount of time, in minutes, that she spends practicing, throwing tantrums, singing, warm-up, costume changes, interviews, meet-and-greet and vocal coaching in the final stage performance?",108.0,"To solve this problem, we need to break down Carlotta's schedule into different activities and calculate the total time spent on each activity.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Total Performance Time:**
   - The final stage performance is 6 minutes long.

2. **Time Spent Singing:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of minutes Carlotta sings on stage.
   - According to the problem, for every 1 minute she sings, she spends an additional 3 minutes practicing and 5 minutes throwing temper tantrums.
   - Therefore, if she sings for \( x \) minutes, she will spend \( 3x + 5x = 8x \) minutes on these activities (practicing and throwing tantrums).

3. **Warm-Up:**
   - Carlotta spends 1 minute on warm-up for each minute singing.
   - So, if she sings for \( x \) minutes, she will spend 1 minute on warm-up.

4. **Costume Changes:**
   - Carlotta spends 2 minutes on costume changes for each minute singing.
   - So, if she sings for \( x \) minutes, she will spend 2 minutes on costume changes.

5. **Interviews:**
   - Carlotta spends 1 minute on interviews for each minute singing.
   - So, if she sings for \( x \) minutes, she will spend 1 minute on interviews.

6. **Meet-and-Greet:**
   - Carlotta spends 3 minutes on meet-and-greet for each minute singing.
   - So, if she sings for \( x \) minutes, she will spend 3 minutes on meet-and-greet.

7. **Vocal Coaching:**
   - Carlotta spends 3 minutes on vocal coaching for each minute singing.
   - So, if she sings for \( x \) minutes, she will spend 3 minutes on vocal coaching.

Now, let's sum up all the times:

\[
\text{Total Time} = (\text{Time spent singing}) + (\text{Time spent practicing and throwing tantrums}) + (\text{Time spent warming up}) + (\text{Time spent changing costumes}) + (\text{Time spent interviewing}) + (\text{Time spent meeting and greeting}) + (\text{Time spent vocal coaching})
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Time} = x + 8x + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
\text{Total Time} = 9x + 10
\]

Given that the total performance time is 6 minutes:

\[
9x + 10 = 6
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
9x = 6 - 10 \\
9x = -4
\]

This equation does not make sense because \( x \) cannot be negative. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding or error in the initial setup. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement and ensure all details are correctly interpreted.

If the total performance time is indeed 6 minutes, then it implies that Carlotta must sing for less than one minute since even with the given ratios, the total time would exceed 6 minutes. This suggests a potential misinterpretation or inconsistency in the problem constraints provided.

However, based on the information given and assuming no errors in the interpretation, the calculation above shows that if Carlotta sings for any positive fraction of a minute, the total time exceeds 6 minutes. 

Therefore, under typical real-world conditions where performances are whole numbers of minutes, the problem as stated has an inherent contradiction unless further clarification is provided about how to handle partial minutes of singing.

Given the current setup, the correct approach should involve ensuring all activities add up to exactly 6 minutes without fractional parts. If such precision were required, the problem might need adjustment to fit within standard performance durations.",6,6.0,False,

1. **Red Candies**: \( R = 40 \)
2. **Yellow Candies**: Let \( Y \) be the number of yellow candies.
3. **Blue Candies**: Blue candies are half as many as yellow candies, so \( B = \frac{Y}{2} \).
4. **Green Candies**: Green candies are half as many as red candies, so \( G = \frac{R}{2} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).
5. **Purple Candies**: Purple candies are ten more than five times the number of yellow candies, so \( P = 5Y + 10 \).
6. **Orange Candies**: Orange candies are one-fourth as many as yellow candies, so \( O = \frac{Y}{4} \).
7. **Brown Candies**: Brown candies are three times as many as blue candies, so \( Br = 3B = 3 \left( \frac{Y}{2} \right) = \frac{3Y}{2} \).
8. **Pink Candies**: Pink candies are one-quarter as many as brown candies, so \( Pk = \frac{Br}{4} = \frac{\frac{3Y}{2}}{4} = \frac{3Y}{8} \).

Now we need to find the total number of candies initially:

\[
Total = R + Y + B + G + P + O + Br + Pk

Y + \frac{Y}{2} + \frac{Y}{4} + \frac{3Y}{2} + \frac{3Y}{8} = \frac{8Y}{8} + \frac{4Y}{8} + \frac{2Y}{8} + \frac{12Y}{8} + \frac{3Y}{8} = \frac{29Y}{8}
\]

So the total is:

\[
Total = 70 + \frac{29Y}{8}
\]

Carlos eats all the yellow candies, which means he eats \( Y \) candies. Therefore, the remaining candies are:

\[
Remaining = Total - Y = 70 + \frac{29Y}{8} - Y
\]

To combine the terms involving \( Y \), convert \( Y \) to a fraction with a denominator of 8:

\[
Y = \frac{8Y}{8}
\]

Thus,

\[
Remaining = 70 + \frac{29Y}{8} - \frac{8Y}{8} = 70 + \frac{21Y}{8}
\]

Since \( Y \) represents the number of yellow candies, it can vary depending on the specific value provided. However, without additional constraints or values for \( Y \), we cannot determine an exact numerical answer. The expression above gives the relationship between the remaining candies and the number of yellow candies.

If we assume \( Y = 40 \) (a reasonable assumption since there are 40 red candies), then:

\[
Remaining = 70 + \frac{21 \times 40}{8} = 70 + 105 = 175
\]

Therefore, if Carlos eats all the yellow candies, there would be 175 candies remaining.",175,175.0,False,

If one gallon of paint covers 600 square feet, how many gallons of paint does Henrietta need to paint her house?",28.0,"To determine how many gallons of paint Henrietta needs, we first calculate the total area of all the walls in the house.

1. **Living Room:**
   - Area = 600 square feet

2. **Bedroom Walls:**
   - Each bedroom wall takes up 400 square feet.
   - There are 3 bedrooms.
   - Total area for bedroom walls = \( 400 \times 3 = 1200 \) square feet.

3. **Kitchen:**
   - Each kitchen wall takes up 500 square feet.
   - There are 6 kitchens.
   - Total area for kitchen walls = \( 500 \times 6 = 3000 \) square feet.

4. **Dining Room:**
   - Each dining room wall takes up 240 square feet.
   - There are 5 dining rooms.
   - Total area for dining room walls = \( 240 \times 5 = 1200 \) square feet.

5. **Bathroom:**
   - Each bathroom wall takes up 150 square feet.
   - There are 8 bathrooms.
   - Total area for bathroom walls = \( 150 \times 8 = 1200 \) square feet.

6. **Garage:**
   - Each garage wall takes up 480 square feet.
   - There are 5 garages.
   - Total area for garage walls = \( 480 \times 5 = 2400 \) square feet.

7. **Hallway:**
   - Each hallway wall takes up 900 square feet.
   - There are 8 hallways.
   - Total area for hallway walls = \( 900 \times 8 = 7200 \) square feet.

Now, summing up all these areas:

\[
\text{Total area} = 600 + 1200 + 3000 + 1200 + 1200 + 2400 + 7200 = 15700 \text{ square feet}
\]

Next, we determine how many gallons of paint are needed. Since one gallon of paint covers 600 square feet:

\[
\text{Number of gallons needed} = \frac{\text{Total area}}{\text{Coverage per gallon}} = \frac{15700}{600} \approx 26.17
\]

Since Henrietta cannot purchase a fraction of a gallon, she will need to round up to the nearest whole number:

\[
\text{Gallons needed} = 27

He also orders 7 bottle of wine at $25.0 each. He also orders 9 shots at $3.5 each. He also orders 4 dessert platter at $9.0 each. He leaves a 30% tip on everything he orders. How much did he spend for the night?,514.65,"To determine how much James spent for the night, we need to break down the expenses and calculate them step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Cost of Entering the Club
James pays $20 to enter the club.

### Step 2: Calculate the Cost of Buying Rides
James buys 2 rounds for his 5 friends, which means he buys 10 rides total. Each ride costs $6, so:
\[ 10 \times 6 = \$60 \]

He also buys 6 drinks for himself, with each drink costing $6:
\[ 6 \times 6 = \$36 \]

So, the total cost for rides and drinks is:
\[ 60 + 36 = \$96 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Cost of Food
James orders fried chicken that costs $14 and 2 nachos at $8 each:
\[ 14 + 2 \times 8 = 14 + 16 = \$30 \]

He also orders 1 bucket of wings that costs $12 and 7 bottles of wine at $25 each:
\[ 12 + 7 \times 25 = 12 + 175 = \$187 \]

And finally, he orders 4 dessert platters at $9 each:
\[ 4 \times 9 = \$36 \]

Adding all these together gives the total cost for food:
\[ 30 + 187 + 36 = \$253 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Cost Before Tax
Now, add up all the individual costs:
\[ 20 + 96 + 253 = \$369 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the Tip
James leaves a 30% tip on everything he ordered. First, find the subtotal before tax:
\[ 369 \]
Then calculate the tip amount:
\[ 0.30 \times 369 = \$110.70 \]

### Step 6: Calculate the Final Total
Add the tip to the subtotal:
\[ 369 + 110.70 = \$479.70 \]

\[ T_r = 3M_r = 3 \times 60 = 180 \]
Tom also collected 5 fewer blue marbles than Jenny, so,
\[ T_b = J_b - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \]

Now, let's determine how many red and blue marbles Sara collected. The problem states that Sara collected 10 fewer red marbles than Anie and five times the number of blue marbles Mary collected. So,
\[ S_r = A_r - 10 = (M_r + 20) - 10 = 60 + 10 = 70 \]
\[ S_b = 5M_b = 5 \times 25 = 125 \]

Finally, let's find out how many red and blue marbles Leo collected. The problem states that Leo collected three times as many red marbles as Jenny and three times as many blue marbles as Jenny. So,
\[ L_r = 3J_r = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]
\[ L_b = 3J_b = 3 \times 25 = 75 \]

And finally, let's find out how many red and blue marbles Maya collected. The problem states that Maya collected five times as many red marbles as Tom and three fewer blue marbles than Sara. So,
\[ M_r = 3T_r = 3 \times 180 = 540 \]
\[ M_b = S_b - 3 = 125 - 3 = 122 \]

Now, we can calculate the total number of blue marbles collected by all the friends combined:
\[ J_b + A_b + M_b + T_b + S_b + L_b + M_b + M_b + M_b + M_b + M_b + M_b + M_b + M_b + M_b + M_b + M_b + M_b + M_b + M_b + M_b + M_b + M_b + M_b + M_b + M_b + M_b + M_b + M_b + M_b + M_b + M_b + M_b +

6,qwen-1.5B,Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct,5,20,19,Natalia is riding a bicycle for the cycling competition. On Monday she rode 40 kilometers and on Tuesday 50 kilometers. On Wednesday she rode 25 kilometers and on Thursday she rode 65 kilometers. On Friday she rode 30 kilometers. On Saturday she rode 50% fewer kilometers than Thursday. On Sunday she rode as many kilometers as the sum of the kilometers from Monday and Saturday. On Next Monday she rode 60 kilometers. On Next Tuesday she rode 20% more kilometers than Next Monday. How many kilometers did Natalia ride in total?,447.0,"To determine the total number of kilometers Natalia rode over the week, we need to calculate the distance she covered each day and then sum these distances.

1. **Monday:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 40 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Tuesday:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 50 \text{ km}
   \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 25 \text{ km}
   \]

4. **Thursday:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 65 \text{ km}
   \]

5. **Friday:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 30 \text{ km}
   \]

6. **Saturday:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 50\% \text{ fewer kilometers than Thursday} = 65 - (0.5 \times 65) = 65 - 32.5 = 32.5 \text{ km}
   \]

7. **Sunday:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{sum of Monday and Saturday} = 40 + 32.5 = 72.5 \text{ km}
   \]

8. **Next Monday:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 60 \text{ km}
   \]

9. **Next Tuesday:**
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 20\% \text{ more kilometers than Next Monday} = 60 + (0.2 \times 60) = 60 + 12 = 72 \text{ km}
   \]

Now, let's sum up all the distances:

First, let's calculate the area of one garden from Mancino:
- Each of his gardens measures 16 feet by 5 feet.
- The area of one garden is \(16 \times 5 = 80\) square feet.

Since he has 3 such gardens:
\[ 3 \times 80 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, let's calculate the area of one garden from Marquita:
- Each of her gardens measures 8 feet by 4 feet.
- The area of one garden is \(8 \times 4 = 32\) square feet.

Since she has 2 such gardens:
\[ 2 \times 32 = 64 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, let's calculate the area of one garden from Luis:
- Each of his gardens measures 10 feet by 6 feet.
- The area of one garden is \(10 \times 6 = 60\) square feet.

Since he has 4 such gardens:
\[ 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ square feet} \]

Next, let's calculate the area of one garden from Tasha:
- Her single garden measures 12 feet by 9 feet.

Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda and half as many pieces of bread as treats. Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda and four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats. Priya brings twice as many treats as Carlos and one-fourth as many pieces of bread as treats. Elena brings 5 more treats than Mia and three times as many pieces of bread as treats. If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",546.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pieces of bread and treats each person brought to the zoo based on the given relationships and then sum them up.

Let's start with Wanda:

- Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread.
- Since Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane, let \( T_J \) be the number of treats Jane brings. Then, \( \frac{1}{2}T_J = 90 \), so \( T_J = 180 \).
- Wanda also brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, which matches our information about her bringing 90 pieces of bread.

Next, let's find out how much Jane brought:

- Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats, so if she brings \( B_J \) pieces of bread, then \( B_J = 0.75T_J \). We already know \( T_J = 180 \), so \( B_J = 0.75 \times 180 = 135 \).

Now, let's calculate for Wanda again but using these values:

- Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane, so \( T_W = \frac{1}{2}B_J = \frac{1}{2} \times 135 = 67.5 \). However, since the number of treats must be an integer, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or typo in the problem statement. Assuming the correct interpretation should be rounding down (since partial treats aren't practical), Wanda would bring 67 treats instead of 67.5.

For Carlos:

- Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane, so \( T_C = \frac{1}{3}T_J = \frac{1}{3} \times 180 = 60 \).
- Carlos brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats, so \( B_C = 2T_C = 2 \times 60 = 120 \).

Mia:

- Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda, so \( T_M = T_W - 10 = 67 - 10 = 57 \).
- Mia brings half as many pieces of bread as treats, so \( B_M = \frac{1}{2}T_M = \frac{1}{2} \times 57 = 28.5 \). Again, assuming rounding down, Mia would bring 28 pieces of bread.

Omar:

- Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda, so \( T_O = 1.5T_W = 1.5 \times 67 = 100.5 \). Rounding down, Omar brings 100 treats.
- Omar brings four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats, so \( B_O = \frac{4}{5}T_O = \frac{4}{5} \times 100 = 80 \).

Priya:

- Priya brings twice as many treats as Carlos, so \( T_P = 2T_C = 2 \times 60 = 120 \).
- Priya brings one-fourth as many pieces of bread as treats, so \( B_P = \frac{1}{4}T_P = \frac{1}{4} \times 120 = 30 \).

Finally, let's add all the treats and pieces of bread together:

- Total treats: \( T_J + T_W + T_C + T_M + T_O + T_P = 180 + 67 + 60 + 57 + 100 + 120 = 684 \)
- Total pieces of bread: \( B_J + B_W + B_C + B_M + B_O + B_P = 135 + 90 + 120 + 28 + 80 + 30 = 493 \)

4. **Han**: \( H = \frac{J}{2} - 2 \) (since Han visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude did and Han visited 2 less than twice as many as Jude)
   \[
   H = \frac{6.5}{2} - 2 = 3.25 - 2 = 1.25

   Again, since the number of rehabilitation centers must be an integer, we need to re-evaluate the steps carefully. Instead, let's use the correct interpretation that Han visited 3 rehabilitation centers.

5. **Jude**: \( U = \frac{H}{2} + 2 \) (since Jude visited half as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa did and Jude visited half as many as Lisa)
   \[
   U = \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 1.5 + 2 = 3.5

   Again, since the number of rehabilitation centers must be an integer, we need to re-evaluate the steps carefully. Instead, let's use the correct interpretation that Jude visited 3 rehabilitation centers.

6. **Omar**: \( O = \frac{U}{2} + 3 \) (since Omar visited 3 more than half as many rehabilitation centers as Jude did and Omar visited 3 more than half as many as Jude)
   \[
   O = \frac{3}{2} + 3 = 1.5 + 3 = 4.5

   Again, since the number of rehabilitation centers must be an integer, we need to re-evaluate the steps carefully. Instead, let's use the correct interpretation that Omar visited 4 rehabilitation centers.

Since the ages of the three oldest brothers are consecutive integers and their total age is 96, we can express their ages as follows:

- The first oldest brother: \( x + 2 \)
- The second oldest brother: \( x + 3 \)
- The third oldest brother: \( x + 4 \)

According to the problem, the sum of these three brothers' ages is 96. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
(x + 2) + (x + 3) + (x + 4) = 96

Simplifying the left side of the equation:

\[
x + 2 + x + 3 + x + 4 = 96

Let's start with the given information:

1. Total produce of mangoes = 400 kg
2. Total produce of apples = 2 * (total produce of mangoes)
3. Total produce of oranges = total produce of mangoes + 200 kg
4. Total produce of bananas = total produce of apples - 100 kg
5. Total produce of peaches = total produce of oranges / 2
6. Total produce of guavas = total produce of mangoes / 4

8. Total produce of plums = 2 * total produce of guavas

Now let's calculate each quantity step-by-step:

1. **Total produce of mangoes**: Given as 400 kg.
2. **Total produce of apples**:
   \[
   \text{Total produce of apples} = 2 \times 400 = 800 \text{ kg}

3. **Total produce of oranges**:
   \[
   \text{Total produce of oranges} = 400 + 200 = 600 \text{ kg}
   \]
4. **Total produce of bananas**:
   \[
   \text{Total produce of bananas} = 800 - 100 = 700 \text{ kg}
   \]
5. **Total produce of peaches**:
   \[
   \text{Total produce of peaches} = \frac{600}{2} = 300 \text{ kg}
   \]
6. **Total produce of guavas**:
   \[
   \text{Total produce of guavas} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ kg}
   \]
7. **Total produce of lemons**:
   \[
   \text{Total produce of lemons} = 300 + 50 = 350 \text{ kg}
   \]
8. **Total produce of plums**:
   \[
   \text{Total produce of plums} = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ kg}

\[ \text{Monthly Cost} = \$50 + \$1000 + (\$30 \times 2) + \$10 = \$50 + \$1000 + \$60 + \$10 = \$1120 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Annual Cost Per Person

Since there are 12 months in a year, the annual cost per person is:
\[ \text{Annual Cost} = \$1120 \times 12 = \$13440 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Annual Cost for All Family Members

There are 4 people in the family (including John), so the total annual cost for all family members is:
\[ \text{Total Annual Cost} = \$13440 \times 4 = \$53760 \]

### Step 4: Add Up All Costs Except for John's Share

We need to add up all costs except for John's share. These include:
- Joining fees: \(4 \times \$4000 = \$16000\)
- One-time processing fee: \$500
- Lockers: \(3 \times \$120 = \$360\)

So, the total cost excluding John's share is:
\[ \text{Total Excluding John} = \$16000 + \$500 + \$360 = \$16860 \]

### Step 5: Calculate John's Share

John agrees to pay half of the total cost, so his share is:
\[ \text{John's Share} = \frac{\$16860}{2} = \$8430 \]

Therefore, the amount John pays for the first year is:

Savanna National park has three times as many flamingos as Safari National park. How many animals in total does Savanna National park have?",795.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each type of animal in both Safari National Park (SNP) and Savanna National Park (SNP). Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of animals in SNP

**Lions in SNP:** 
- SNP has 100 lions.

**Snakes in SNP:** 
- SNP has half as many snakes as lions.
\[
\text{Number of snakes} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
\]

**Giraffes in SNP:** 
- SNP has 10 fewer giraffes than snakes.
\[
\text{Number of giraffes} = 50 - 10 = 40
\]

**Zebras in SNP:** 
- SNP has twice as many zebras as giraffes.
\[
\text{Number of zebras} = 2 \times 40 = 80
\]

**Elephants in SNP:** 
- SNP has 5 fewer elephants than snakes.
\[
\text{Number of elephants} = 50 - 5 = 45
\]

**Monkeys in SNP:** 
- SNP has three times as many monkeys as giraffes.
\[
\text{Number of monkeys} = 3 \times 40 = 120
\]

**Crocodiles in SNP:** 
- SNP has one-fifth as many crocodiles as lions.
\[
\text{Number of crocodiles} = \frac{100}{5} = 20
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of animals in SNP

**Lions in SNP:** 
- SNP has double as many lions as SNP.
\[
\text{Number of lions} = 2 \times 100 = 200
\]

**Snakes in SNP:** 
- SNP has triple as many snakes as SNP.
\[
\text{Number of snakes} = 3 \times 100 = 300
\]

**Giraffes in SNP:** 
- SNP has 20 more giraffes than SNP.
\[
\text{Number of giraffes} = 40 + 20 = 60
\]

**Zebras in SNP:** 
- SNP has half as many zebras as lions.
\[
\text{Number of zebras} = \frac{200}{2} = 100
\]

**Elephants in SNP:** 
- SNP has 20 more elephants than SNP.
\[
\text{Number of elephants} = 45 + 20 = 65
\]

**Monkeys in SNP:** 
- SNP has 10 fewer monkeys than zebras.
\[
\text{Number of monkeys} = 100 - 10 = 90
\]

**Crocodiles in SNP:** 
- SNP has twice as many crocodiles as SNP.
\[
\text{Number of crocodiles} = 2 \times 20 = 40
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of animals in SNP

Sum up all the animals in SNP:
\[
\text{Total animals in SNP} = 200 (\text{lions}) + 300 (\text{snakes}) + 60 (\text{giraffes}) + 100 (\text{zebras}) + 65 (\text{elephants}) + 90 (\text{monkeys}) + 40 (\text{crocodiles})
\]
\[
= 200 + 300 + 60 + 100 + 65 + 90 + 40 = 755

First, let's find the cost of each type of animal:

1. **Goats:**
   - Number of goats: \(3\)
   - Cost per goat: \$\(400\)
   - Total cost for goats: \(3 \times 400 = 1200\) dollars

2. **Llamas:**
   - Number of llamas: \(2 \times 3 = 6\)
   - Cost per llama: \(400 + (400 \times 0.5) = 400 + 200 = 600\) dollars
   - Total cost for llamas: \(6 \times 600 = 3600\) dollars

3. **Alpacas:**
   - Number of alpacas: \(4\)
   - Cost per alpaca: \(600 - (600 \times 0.25) = 600 - 150 = 450\) dollars
   - Total cost for alpacas: \(4 \times 450 = 1800\) dollars

4. **Zebras:**
   - Number of zebras: \(2\)
   - Cost per zebra: \(400 \times 2 = 800\) dollars
   - Total cost for zebras: \(2 \times 800 = 1600\) dollars

5. **Ponies:**
   - Number of ponies: \(3\)
   - Cost per pony: \(400 + 100 = 500\) dollars
   - Total cost for ponies: \(3 \times 500 = 1500\) dollars

6. **Peacocks:**
   - Number of peacocks: \(5\)
   - Cost per peacock: \(500 - (500 \times 0.5) = 500 - 250 = 250\) dollars
   - Total cost for peacocks: \(5 \times 250 = 1250\) dollars

7. **Kangaroos:**
   - Number of kangaroos: \(3\)
   - Cost per kangaroo: \(800 \times 1.20 = 960\) dollars

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Optimal Wind Conditions (Two Sails):**
   - Speed: 50 knots
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Distance: \( 50 \text{ knots} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ nautical miles} \)
   - Convert to land miles: \( 200 \text{ nautical miles} \times 1.15 \text{ land miles/nautical mile} = 230 \text{ land miles} \)

2. **Optimal Wind Conditions (One Sail):**
   - Speed: 25 knots
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Distance: \( 25 \text{ knots} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 100 \text{ nautical miles} \)
   - Convert to land miles: \( 100 \text{ nautical miles} \times 1.15 \text{ land miles/nautical mile} = 115 \text{ land miles} \)

3. **Three Sails:**
   - Speed: 60 knots
   - Time: 1 hour
   - Distance: \( 60 \text{ knots} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ nautical miles} \)
   - Convert to land miles: \( 60 \text{ nautical miles} \times 1.15 \text{ land miles/nautical mile} = 69 \text{ land miles} \)

4. **Four Sails:**
   - Speed: 70 knots
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance: \( 70 \text{ knots} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ nautical miles} \)
   - Convert to land miles: \( 140 \text{ nautical miles} \times 1.15 \text{ land miles/nautical mile} = 161 \text{ land miles} \)

5. **Reefed Sail:**
   - Speed: 15 knots
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Distance: \( 15 \text{ knots} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ nautical miles} \)
   - Convert to land miles: \( 60 \text{ nautical miles} \times 1.15 \text{ land miles/nautical mile} = 69 \text{ land miles} \)

6. **Extra Cargo:**
   - Speed: 40 knots
   - Time: 1 hour
   - Distance: \( 40 \text{ knots} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 40 \text{ nautical miles} \)
   - Convert to land miles: \( 40 \text{ nautical miles} \times 1.15 \text{ land miles/nautical mile} = 46 \text{ land miles} \)

7. **Current Setup:**
   - Speed: 30 knots
   - Time: 2 hours

First, let's determine the price of men's t-shirts:

- White men's t-shirts: $20
- Black men's t-shirts: $18
- Blue men's t-shirts: $22
- Red men's t-shirts: $21
- Green men's t-shirts: $19
- Gray men's t-shirts: $17
- Yellow men's t-shirts: $16

Now, let's find the price of women's t-shirts. We know that women's t-shirts are $5 cheaper than men's t-shirts of the same color. So, we can subtract $5 from the prices of men's t-shirts to get the prices of women's t-shirts:

- White women's t-shirts: $20 - $5 = $15
- Black women's t-shirts: $18 - $5 = $13
- Blue women's t-shirts: $22 - $5 = $17
- Red women's t-shirts: $21 - $5 = $16
- Green women's t-shirts: $19 - $5 = $14
- Gray women's t-shirts: $17 - $5 = $12
- Yellow women's t-shirts: $16 - $5 = $11

Next, we'll calculate the total cost for each sector. Since each sector has 10 men and 10 women, and there are 7 sectors, we have:

- Total number of men: \(10 \times 7 = 70\)
- Total number of women: \(10 \times 7 = 70\)

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of shirt:

- Men's t-shirts:
  - White: \(70 \times \$20 = \$1400\)
  - Black: \(70 \times \$18 = \$1260\)
  - Blue: \(70 \times \$22 = \$1540\)
  - Red: \(70 \times \$21 = \$1470\)
  - Green: \(70 \times \$19 = \$1330\)
  - Gray: \(70 \times \$17 = \$1190\)
  - Yellow: \(70 \times \$16 = \$1120\)

- Women's t-shirts:
  - White: \(70 \times \$15 = \$1050\)
  - Black: \(70 \times \$13 = \$910\)
  - Blue: \(70 \times \$17 = \$1190\)
  - Red: \(70 \times \$16 = \$1120\)
  - Green: \(70 \times \$14 = \$980\)
  - Gray: \(70 \times \$12 = \$840\)
  - Yellow: \(70 \times \$11 = \$770\)

Finally, we add up the totals for both men's and women's t-shirts to get the overall total spent:

- Spiders: Each spider has 8 legs. Since there are 8 spiders, the total number of legs from the spiders is \(8 \times 8 = 64\).
- Ants: Each ant has 6 legs. Since there are 12 ants, the total number of legs from the ants is \(12 \times 6 = 72\).
- Beetles: Each beetle has 6 legs. Since there are 5 beetles, the total number of legs from the beetles is \(5 \times 6 = 30\).
- Scorpions: Each scorpion has 8 legs. Since there are 3 scorpions, the total number of legs from the scorpions is \(3 \times 8 = 24\).
- Crickets: Each cricket has 6 legs. Since there are 10 crickets, the total number of legs from the crickets is \(10 \times 6 = 60\).

Let's denote the number of red gumballs as \( R \).

Given that there are 16 red gumballs (\( R = 16 \)):

1. **Blue Gumballs:**
   - The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs.
   - Number of blue gumballs (\( B \)) = \( \frac{R}{2} \)
   - Substituting \( R = 16 \):
     \[
     B = \frac{16}{2} = 8
     \]

2. **Green Gumballs:**
   - For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs.
   - Number of green gumballs (\( G \)) = \( 4B \)
   - Substituting \( B = 8 \):
     \[
     G = 4 \times 8 = 32

3. **Yellow Gumballs:**
   - The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs.
   - Number of yellow gumballs (\( Y \)) = \( B \)
   - Substituting \( B = 8 \):
     \[
     Y = 8
     \]

4. **Purple Gumballs:**
   - The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs.
   - Number of purple gumballs (\( P \)) = \( R - 3 \)
   - Substituting \( R = 16 \):
     \[
     P = 16 - 3 = 13
     \]

5. **Orange Gumballs:**
   - The machine has twice as many orange gumballs as blue gumballs.
   - Number of orange gumballs (\( O \)) = \( 2B \)
   - Substituting \( B = 8 \):
     \[
     O = 2 \times 8 = 16
     \]

6. **Pink Gumballs:**
   - The machine has one-fourth as many pink gumballs as green gumballs.
   - Number of pink gumballs (\( K \)) = \( \frac{G}{4} \)
   - Substituting \( G = 32 \):
     \[
     K = \frac{32}{4} = 8
     \]

7. **White Gumballs:**
   - The machine has as many white gumballs as the total number of yellow and blue gumballs combined.
   - Total number of yellow and blue gumballs (\( Y + B \)):
     \[
     Y + B = 8 + 8 = 16
     \]
   - Number of white gumballs (\( W \)) = \( Y + B \)
   - Substituting \( Y + B = 16 \):
     \[
     W = 16
     \]

Now, let's sum up all the gumballs to find the total number of gumballs in the machine:

\[
R + B + G + Y + P + O + K + W = 16 + 8 + 32 + 8 + 13 + 16 + 8 + 16
