Alice has 5 times as many sheep as Bob. Bob has 3 times as many sheep as David. David has 2 times as many sheep as Zoe. Zoe has 4 times as many sheep as John. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle, Alice, Bob, David, Zoe and John have together if John has 20 sheep?",65540.0,"To determine the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle, Alice, Bob, David, Zoe, and John have together, we start by defining the number of sheep each person has in terms of John's sheep. We know that John has 20 sheep. Let's denote the number of sheep John has by \( J \). Therefore, \( J = 20 \).

Next, we use the given relationships to find the number of sheep each person has:
- Zoe has 4 times as many sheep as John. So, the number of sheep Zoe has is \( 4J = 4 \times 20 = 80 \).
- David has 2 times as many sheep as Zoe. So, the number of sheep David has is \( 2 \times 80 = 160 \).
- Bob has 3 times as many sheep as David. So, the number of sheep Bob has is \( 3 \times 160 = 480 \).
- Alice has 5 times as many sheep as Bob. So, the number of sheep Alice has is \( 5 \times 480 = 2400 \).
- Seattle has 2 times as many sheep as Alice. So, the number of sheep Seattle has is \( 2 \times 2400 = 4800 \).
- Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. So, the number of sheep Charleston has is \( 4 \times 4800 = 19200 \).
- Toulouse has 2 times as many sheep as Charleston. So, the number of sheep Toulouse has is \( 2 \times 19200 = 38400 \).

Now, we sum the number of sheep each person has:
\[
J + \text{Zoe} + \text{David} + \text{Bob} + \text{Alice} + \text{Seattle} + \text{Charleston} + \text{Toulouse} = 20 + 80 + 160 + 480 + 2400 + 4800 + 19200 + 38400
\]

Adding these values step by step:
\[
20 + 80 = 100
\]
\[
100 + 160 = 260
\]
\[
260 + 480 = 740

\[
740 + 2400 = 3140

1. Calculate the total amount of rain collected over the week.
2. Determine the total amount of water collected based on the rain.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the water.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rain collected over the week.**

The rain collected each day is as follows:
- Monday: 4 inches
- Tuesday: 3 inches
- Wednesday: 2 inches
- Thursday: 1 inch
- Friday: 5 inches

We will do this by summing the square footage of the walls in each room.

1. **Living Room:**
   \[
   600 \text{ square feet}

2. **Bedroom:**
   Each bedroom wall takes up 400 square feet, and there are 3 bedroom walls.
   \[
   400 \text{ square feet/wall} \times 3 \text{ walls} = 1200 \text{ square feet}

3. **Kitchen:**
   Each kitchen wall takes up 500 square feet, and there are 6 kitchen walls.
   \[
   500 \text{ square feet/wall} \times 6 \text{ walls} = 3000 \text{ square feet}
   \]

4. **Dining Room:**
   Each dining room wall takes up 240 square feet, and there are 5 dining room walls.
   \[
   240 \text{ square feet/wall} \times 5 \text{ walls} = 1200 \text{ square feet}

5. **Bathroom:**
   Each bathroom wall takes up 150 square feet, and there are 8 bathroom walls.
   \[
   150 \text{ square feet/wall} \times 8 \text{ walls} = 1200 \text{ square feet}

6. **Garage:**
   Each garage wall takes up 480 square feet, and there are 5 garage walls.
   \[
   480 \text{ square feet/wall} \times 5 \text{ walls} = 2400 \text{ square feet}

7. ** Hallway:**
   Each hallway wall takes up 900 square feet, and there are 8 hallway walls.
   \[
   900 \text{ square feet/wall} \times 8 \text{ walls} = 7200 \text{ square feet}

Next, we sum the square footage of all the walls:
\[
600 + 1200 + 3000 + 1200 + 1200 + 2400 + 7200

Let's add these step by step:
\[
600 + 1200 = 1800

The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
\]

Let's start with Mancino:
- Mancino has 3 gardens, each measuring 16 feet by 5 feet.
- The area of one garden is \(16 \times 5 = 80\) square feet.
- Therefore, the total area for Mancino's gardens is \(3 \times 80 = 240\) square feet.

Next, let's calculate for Marquita:
- Marquita has 2 gardens, each measuring 8 feet by 4 feet.
- The area of one garden is \(8 \times 4 = 32\) square feet.
- Therefore, the total area for Marquita's gardens is \(2 \times 32 = 64\) square feet.

Now, let's calculate for Luis:
- Luis has 4 gardens, each measuring 10 feet by 6 feet.
- The area of one garden is \(10 \times 6 = 60\) square feet.
- Therefore, the total area for Luis's gardens is \(4 \times 60 = 240\) square feet.

Next, let's calculate for Tasha:
- Tasha has 1 garden measuring 12 feet by 9 feet.
- The area of one garden is \(12 \times 9 = 108\) square feet.

First, let's find out how many treats Wanda brought. We know that Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread and three times as many pieces of bread as treats. Let \( T_W \) be the number of treats Wanda brought. Then:
\[ 3T_W = 90 \]
\[ T_W = \frac{90}{3} = 30 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of treats and pieces of bread each person brought:

1. **Jane**: Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats. Let \( T_J \) be the number of treats Jane brought. Then:
\[ T_J = T_W = 30 \]
\[ \text{Pieces of bread Jane brought} = 0.75 \times T_J = 0.75 \times 30 = 22.5 \]
Since the number of pieces of bread must be a whole number, we assume it was a typo and should be 22.5. However, we need to recheck the problem again.

2. **Wanda**: Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread and 30 treats.

3. **Carlos**: Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane and twice as many pieces of bread as treats. Then:
\[ T_C = \frac{T_J}{3} = \frac{30}{3} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Pieces of bread Carlos brought} = 2 \times T_C = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

4. **Mia**: Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda and half as many pieces of bread as treats. Then:
\[ T_M = T_W - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]
\[ \text{Pieces of bread Mia brought} = \frac{T_M}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

5. **Omar**: Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda and four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats. Then:
\[ T_O = 1.5 \times T_W = 1.5 \times 30 = 45 \]
\[ \text{Pieces of bread Omar brought} = \frac{4}{5} \times T_O = \frac{4}{5} \times 45 = 36 \]

6. **Priya**: Priya brings twice as many treats as Carlos and one-fourth as many pieces of bread as treats. Then:
\[ T_P = 2 \times T_C = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]
\[ \text{Pieces of bread Priya brought} = \frac{T_P}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

7. **Elena**: Elena brings 5 more treats than Mia and three times as many pieces of bread as treats. Then:
\[ T_E = T_M + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \]
\[ \text{Pieces of bread Elena brought} = 3 \times T_E = 3 \times 25 = 75 \]

Now, we sum up the total number of treats and pieces of bread brought by everyone:
\[ \text{Total treats} = T_J + T_W + T_C + T_M + T_O + T_P + T_E = 30 + 30 + 10 + 20 + 45 + 20 + 25 = 180 \]

They also have a younger brother named Mason who is 1 year younger than Ethan. How old is the youngest brother?,26.0,"To determine the age of the youngest brother, we start by defining the ages of the three oldest brothers. Let the age of the youngest brother among the three oldest be \( x \). Since the ages are consecutive integers, the ages of the three oldest brothers can be expressed as \( x \), \( x+1 \), and \( x+2 \).

The sum of their ages is given as 96. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 96
\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[
3x + 3 = 96
\]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[
3x = 93
\]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[
x = 31
\]

So, the youngest brother among the three oldest is 31 years old. The ages of the three oldest brothers are 31, 32, and 33.

Next, we determine the ages of the younger brothers. Liam is 1 year younger than the youngest of the three oldest brothers, so Liam is:
\[
31 - 1 = 30
\]

Noah is 1 year younger than Liam, so Noah is:
\[
30 - 1 = 29

Owen is 1 year younger than Noah, so Owen is:
\[

Ethan is 1 year younger than Owen, so Ethan is:
\[
28 - 1 = 27

Mason is 1 year younger than Ethan, so Mason is:

How much money in total did she put into her savings?",166.0,"To determine how much money Opal put into her savings, we will follow each step of her betting and savings process, calculating the amount she saves at each stage.

1. **Initial Winnings:**
   Opal starts with $100.00.
   She puts half into savings:
   \[
   \text{Savings} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]
   She bets the other half:
   \[
   \text{Bet} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

2. **First Bet:**
   She makes a 60% profit on the $50 she bet:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 50 \times 0.60 = 30
   \]
   She puts half of her profit into savings:
   \[
   \text{Savings} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]
   She bets the other half of her profit:
   \[
   \text{Bet} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]

3. **Second Bet:**
   She makes a 25% profit on the $15 she bet:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 15 \times 0.25 = 3.75

- Giraffes: \( 50 - 10 = 40 \)
- Zebras: \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \)
- Elephants: \( 50 - 5 = 45 \)
- Monkeys: \( 3 \times 40 = 120 \)
- Crocodiles: \( \frac{100}{5} = 20 \)
- Flamingos: \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)

Now, let's find the number of each type of animal in Savanna National Park:

How much did he spend?",13830.0,"To determine the total amount Tim spent on animals for his zoo, we need to calculate the cost of each type of animal and then sum these costs. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of goats:**
   Tim buys 3 goats, and each goat costs $400.
   \[
   3 \times 400 = 1200
   \]
   So, the total cost for goats is $1200.

2. **Cost of llamas:**
   Tim gets twice as many llamas as goats, so he gets \(3 \times 2 = 6\) llamas. Each llama costs 50% more than a goat, so each llama costs \(400 + 0.5 \times 400 = 400 + 200 = 600\).
   \[
   6 \times 600 = 3600
   \]
   So, the total cost for llamas is $3600.

3. **Cost of alpacas:**
   Tim buys 4 alpacas, and each alpaca costs 25% less than a llama, so each alpaca costs \(600 - 0.25 \times 600 = 600 - 150 = 450\).
   \[
   4 \times 450 = 1800
   \]
   So, the total cost for alpacas is $1800.

4. **Cost of zebras:**
   Tim buys 2 zebras, and each zebra costs twice as much as a goat, so each zebra costs \(2 \times 400 = 800\).
   \[
   2 \times 800 = 1600
   \]
   So, the total cost for zebras is $1600.

5. **Cost of ponies:**
   Tim buys as many ponies as goats, so he buys 3 ponies. Each pony costs $100 more than a goat, so each pony costs \(400 + 100 = 500\).
   \[
   3 \times 500 = 1500
   \]
   So, the total cost for ponies is $1500.

6. **Cost of peacocks:**
   Tim buys 5 peacocks, and each peacock costs 50% less than a pony, so each peacock costs \(500 - 0.5 \times 500 = 500 - 250 = 250\).
   \[
   5 \times 250 = 1250
   \]
   So, the total cost for peacocks is $1250.

7. **Cost of kangaroos:**
   Tim buys 3 kangaroos, and each kangaroo costs 20% more than a zebra, so each kangaroo costs \(800 + 0.2 \times 800 = 800 + 160 = 960\).

- Therefore, the total cost of Nina's order is \(8 + 7 + 6 = 21\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the orders of the two friends who each ordered 1 cup of coffee and 2 bowls of ice cream:
- Each friend ordered 1 cup of coffee and 2 bowls of ice cream.
- The cost of 1 cup of coffee is \(4\) dollars.
- The cost of 2 bowls of ice cream is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of each friend's order is \(4 + 6 = 10\) dollars.
- Since there are two friends, the total cost for their orders is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of Omar's order:
- Omar ordered 3 cups of coffee and 1 piece of cake.
- The cost of 3 cups of coffee is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.
- The cost of 1 piece of cake is \(7\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of Omar's order is \(12 + 7 = 19\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the orders of the three friends who each ordered 1 cup of coffee and 1 piece of cake:
- Each friend ordered 1 cup of coffee and 1 piece of cake.
- The cost of 1 cup of coffee is \(4\) dollars.
- The cost of 1 piece of cake is \(7\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of each friend's order is \(4 + 7 = 11\) dollars.
- Since there are three friends, the total cost for their orders is \(3 \times 11 = 33\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of Ava's order:
- Ava only bought 4 bowls of ice cream.
- The cost of 4 bowls of ice cream is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of Ava's order is \(12\) dollars.

Now, we sum the costs of all the orders:
\[
15 + 36 + 21 + 20 + 19 + 33 + 12 = 166

He needs to know how many pieces to cut the lasagna into to serve it. Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Another friend, Nora, is picky and will only eat one-third of what Manny eats, and Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. Another friend, Ben, will eat the same amount of lasagna as Kai. Another friend, Tina, loves lasagna and will eat 3 pieces. Another friend, Omar, will eat half as much as Kai. Another friend, Zoe, will eat one more piece of lasagna than Manny. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",15.0,"To determine how many pieces Manny should cut his lasagna into, we need to calculate the amount of lasagna each person will eat and then sum these amounts.

1. **Manny**: Manny will eat 1 piece.
2. **Aaron**: Aaron will eat 0 pieces.
3. **Kai**: Kai will eat twice as much as Manny, so Kai will eat \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pieces.
4. **Raphael**: Raphael will eat half the amount Manny does, so Raphael will eat \(\frac{1}{2} \times 1 = 0.5\) pieces.
5. **Lisa**: Lisa will eat 2 pieces plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Since Raphael eats 0.5 pieces, he has \(0.5\) pieces left. Therefore, Lisa will eat \(2 + 0.5 = 2.5\) pieces.
6. **Nora**: Nora will eat one-third of what Manny eats, so Nora will eat \(\frac{1}{3} \times 1 = \frac{1}{3}\) pieces. Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. Since Nora eats \(\frac{1}{3}\) pieces, Lisa will eat \(2.5 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{7.5}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{6.5}{3} = \frac{13}{6}\) pieces.
7. **Ben**: Ben will eat the same amount of lasagna as Kai, so Ben will eat 2 pieces.
8. **Tina**: Tina will eat 3 pieces.
9. **Omar**: Omar will eat half as much as Kai, so Omar will eat \(\frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1\) piece.
10. **Zoe**: Zoe will eat one more piece of lasagna than Manny, so Zoe will eat \(1 + 1 = 2\) pieces.

Now, we sum the amounts of lasagna each person will eat:
\[
1 + 0 + 2 + 0.5 + 2.5 + \frac{1}{3} + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 0.5 + 2.5 + \frac{1}{3} + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 14 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{42}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{43}{3} \approx 14.33
\]

Since Manny cannot cut the lasagna into a fraction of a piece, he needs to cut it into 15 pieces to ensure everyone gets at least their share.

Therefore, the final answer is:

How much did he spend total on buying t-shirts?",2310.0,"To determine the total amount Juan spent on buying t-shirts, we need to calculate the cost for each color of t-shirt separately and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the cost of each color of women's t-shirts:
- White women's t-shirts: $20 - $5 = $15
- Black women's t-shirts: $18 - $5 = $13
- Blue women's t-shirts: $22 - $5 = $17
- Red women's t-shirts: $21 - $5 = $16
- Green women's t-shirts: $19 - $5 = $14
- Gray women's t-shirts: $17 - $5 = $12
- Yellow women's t-shirts: $16 - $5 = $11

Next, we calculate the total cost for each color of t-shirts by multiplying the cost of each color by the number of men and women (10 each) and then summing the costs for men and women.

1. **White t-shirts:**
   - Cost for men: $20 * 10 = $200

- Tori has 4 letters.
- Lily has 4 letters.
- Patrice has 7 letters.
- Ava has 4 letters.
- Monique has 7 letters.
- Ben has 3 letters.
