If her final stage performance is 6 minutes long, what is the total combined amount of time, in minutes, that she spends practicing, throwing tantrums, singing, warm-up, costume changes, interviews, meet-and-greet and vocal coaching in the final stage performance?",108.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time spent on each activity based on the given information and then sum these times.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Time Spent Singing:**
   - Carlotta's final stage performance is 6 minutes long.
   - Therefore, the time spent singing is \(6\) minutes.

2. **Time Spent Practicing:**
   - For every 1 minute of singing, Carlotta spends an additional 3 minutes practicing.
   - Thus, the time spent practicing is \(3 \times 6 = 18\) minutes.

3. **Time Spent Throwing Tantrums:**
   - For every 1 minute of singing, Carlotta spends an additional 5 minutes throwing tantrums.
   - Thus, the time spent throwing tantrums is \(5 \times 6 = 30\) minutes.

4. **Time Spent Warm-Up:**
   - Carlotta spends 1 minute warming up for each minute of singing.
   - Thus, the time spent warming up is \(1 \times 6 = 6\) minutes.

5. **Time Spent Costume Changes:**
   - Carlotta spends 1 minute changing costumes for each minute of singing.
   - Thus, the time spent changing costumes is \(1 \times 6 = 6\) minutes.

6. **Time Spent Interviews:**
   - Carlotta spends 3 minutes interviewing for each minute of singing.
   - Thus, the time spent interviewing is \(3 \times 6 = 18\) minutes.

7. **Time Spent Meet-and-Greet:**
   - Carlotta spends 2 minutes meeting and greeting for each minute of singing.
   - Thus, the time spent meeting and greeting is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) minutes.

8. **Time Spent Vocal Coaching:**
   - Carlotta spends 2 minutes vocal coaching for each minute of singing.
   - Thus, the time spent vocal coaching is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) minutes.

### Total Combined Time Calculation:

Now, we sum all the individual times calculated above:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Singing} + \text{Practicing} + \text{Throwing Tantrums} + \text{Warm-Up} + \text{Costume Changes} + \text{Interviews} + \text{Meet-and-Greet} + \text{Vocal Coaching}

How many pills does Holly take in a week?",231.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pills Holly takes each day and then multiply that by 7 to find out how many pills she takes in a week.

Let's break down the information given:

1. **Insulin Pills**: Holly takes 2 pills per day.
2. **Blood Pressure Pills**: Holly takes 3 pills per day.
3. **Anticonvulsants**: Holly takes twice as many anticonvulsants as blood pressure pills. Since she takes 3 blood pressure pills per day, she takes \(2 \times 3 = 6\) anticonvulsant pills per day.
4. **Vitamin C**: Holly takes as many vitamin C pills as insulin pills. Since she takes 2 insulin pills per day, she takes 2 vitamin C pills per day.
5. **Cholesterol**: Holly takes twice as many cholesterol pills as blood pressure pills. Since she takes 3 blood pressure pills per day, she takes \(2 \times 3 = 6\) cholesterol pills per day.
6. **Allergy**: Holly takes as many allergy pills as anticonvulsants pills. Since she takes 6 anticonvulsant pills per day, she takes 6 allergy pills per day.
7. **Thyroid**: Holly takes as many thyroid pills as cholesterol pills. Since she takes 6 cholesterol pills per day, she takes 6 thyroid pills per day.
8. **Probiotic**: Holly takes as many probiotic pills as insulin pills. Since she takes 2 insulin pills per day, she takes 2 probiotic pills per day.

Now, let's sum up the total number of pills Holly takes each day:

How many items does each baggie have?",34.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of items Mille has and then divide them equally among the 16 kids.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the number of each type of snack:**
   - Pretzels: 64
   - Goldfish: Four times as many as pretzels = \( 4 \times 64 = 256 \)
   - Suckers: 32
   - Granola bars: 32
   - Fruit snacks: 16
   - Crackers: Twice as many as granola bars = \( 2 \times 32 = 64 \)
   - Cookies: Twice as many as fruit snacks = \( 2 \times 16 = 32 \)
   - Carrots: Three times as many as fruit snacks = \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \)

2. **Sum up all the items:**
   - Total pretzels: 64
   - Total goldfish: 256
   - Total suckers: 32
   - Total granola bars: 32
   - Total fruit snacks: 16
   - Total crackers: 64
   - Total cookies: 32
   - Total carrots: 48

   Adding these together:
   \[
   64 + 256 + 32 + 32 + 16 + 64 + 32 + 48 = 596
   \]

3. **Divide the total number of items by the number of kids:**
   - Number of kids: 16
   - Items per baggie: \( \frac{596}{16} \)

4. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{596}{16} = 37.25

   There are three-quarters as many pink candies as brown candies:
   \[
   Pn = \frac{3}{4}Br
   \]
   Substituting \( Br = 200 \):
   \[
   Pn = \frac{3}{4}(200) = 150
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of candies initially

\[
\text{Total candies} = R + Y + B + G + P + O + Br + Pn
\]
Substituting the values we found:
\[
\text{Total candies} = 40 + 100 + 50 + 20 + 490 + 20 + 200 + 150
\]

### Step 3: Sum up the total number of candies

\[
\text{Total candies} = 40 + 100 + 50 + 20 + 490 + 20 + 200 + 150 = 1170
\]

### Step 4: Subtract the number of yellow candies eaten by Carlos

Since Carlos ate all the yellow candies:
\[
\text{Remaining candies} = \text{Total candies} - Y
\]
Substituting \( Y = 100 \):
\[
\text{Remaining candies} = 1170 - 100 = 1070
\]

The hallway walls (each) take up 900 square feet and there are 8 of them. If one gallon of paint covers 600 square feet, how many gallons of paint does Henrietta need to paint her house?",28.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total wall area that needs to be painted and then determine how many gallons of paint are required based on the coverage of one gallon.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Living Room Walls:**
   - Area: 600 square feet

2. **Bedroom Walls:**
   - Each bedroom wall area: 400 square feet
   - Number of bedrooms: 3
   - Total area for bedroom walls: \( 400 \times 3 = 1200 \) square feet

3. **Kitchen Walls:**
   - Each kitchen wall area: 500 square feet
   - Number of kitchens: 6
   - Total area for kitchen walls: \( 500 \times 6 = 3000 \) square feet

4. **Dining Room Walls:**
   - Each dining room wall area: 240 square feet
   - Number of dining rooms: 5
   - Total area for dining room walls: \( 240 \times 5 = 1200 \) square feet

5. **Bathroom Walls:**
   - Each bathroom wall area: 150 square feet
   - Number of bathrooms: 8
   - Total area for bathroom walls: \( 150 \times 8 = 1200 \) square feet

6. **Garage Walls:**
   - Each garage wall area: 480 square feet
   - Number of garages: 5
   - Total area for garage walls: \( 480 \times 5 = 2400 \) square feet

7. **Hallway Walls:**
   - Each hallway wall area: 900 square feet
   - Number of hallways: 8
   - Total area for hallway walls: \( 900 \times 8 = 7200 \) square feet

### Total Wall Area Calculation:

Now, sum up all the areas calculated above:

\[
600 + 1200 + 3000 + 1200 + 1200 + 2400 + 7200 = 16600 \text{ square feet}
\]

### Paint Coverage Calculation:

One gallon of paint covers 600 square feet. To find out how many gallons are needed, divide the total wall area by the coverage per gallon:

\[
\frac{16600}{600} \approx 27.67
\]

Since you can't buy a fraction of a gallon of paint, you need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, Henrietta needs:

\[
\lceil 27.67 \rceil = 28 \text{ gallons}

He decides to eat some food so he orders fried chicken which costs $14. He also orders 2 nachos at $8.0 each. He also orders 1 wings (bucket) at $12.0 each. He also orders 7 bottle of wine at $25.0 each. He also orders 9 shots at $3.5 each. He also orders 4 dessert platter at $9.0 each. He leaves a 30% tip on everything he orders. How much did he spend for the night?,514.65,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps and calculate the total cost including the tip.

### Step 1: Calculate the entrance fee
James pays an entrance fee of $20.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of drinks for his friends
James buys 2 rounds for his 5 friends. Each round consists of 5 drinks (one for each friend).

\[
\text{Total drinks for friends} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ drinks}
\]

Each drink costs $6.

\[
\text{Cost for drinks for friends} = 10 \times 6 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of drinks for James
James buys 6 drinks for himself.

\[
\text{Cost for drinks for James} = 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of food
James orders:
- Fried chicken: $14
- 2 nachos: \(2 \times 8 = 16\) dollars
- 1 bucket of wings: \(1 \times 12 = 12\) dollars
- 7 bottles of wine: \(7 \times 25 = 175\) dollars
- 9 shots: \(9 \times 3.5 = 31.5\) dollars
- 4 dessert platters: \(4 \times 9 = 36\) dollars

\[
\text{Total cost of food} = 14 + 16 + 12 + 175 + 31.5 + 36 = 294.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost before tip
Add up all the individual costs:

\[
\text{Total cost before tip} = 20 + 60 + 36 + 294.5 = 410.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the tip
James leaves a 30% tip on the total cost before tip.

\[
\text{Tip amount} = 0.30 \times 410.5 = 123.15 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 7: Calculate the total cost including tip
Add the tip to the total cost before tip:

\[
\text{Total cost including tip} = 410.5 + 123.15 = 533.65 \text{ dollars}

- Franzia: \( F \)
- Carlo Rosi: \( C \)
- Twin Valley: \( T \)
- Silver Ridge: \( S \)
- Old Vine: \( O \)
- Crestwood: \( Cr \)
- Barrel Hill: \( Bh \)
- Sunset: \( Su \)

We are given the following relationships:

1. \( F = 3C \)
2. \( C = 4T \)
3. \( S = F \)
4. \( O = 2T \)
5. \( Cr = C \)
6. \( Bh = O \)
7. \( Su = Cr \)

We also know that \( C = 40 \) years.

Now let's solve for each wine's age using these relationships:

1. From \( C = 40 \):
   \[
   C = 40
   \]

2. Using \( C = 4T \):
   \[
   40 = 4T \implies T = \frac{40}{4} = 10
   \]

3. Using \( F = 3C \):
   \[
   F = 3 \times 40 = 120
   \]

4. Using \( S = F \):
   \[
   S = 120
   \]

5. Using \( O = 2T \):
   \[
   O = 2 \times 10 = 20

6. Using \( Cr = C \):
   \[
   Cr = 40

7. Using \( Bh = O \):
   \[
   Bh = 20
   \]

8. Using \( Su = Cr \):
   \[
   Su = 40

Now we have the ages of all the wines:
- Franzia (\( F \)): 120 years
- Carlo Rosi (\( C \)): 40 years

- Old Vine (\( O \)): 20 years
- Crestwood (\( Cr \)): 40 years
- Barrel Hill (\( Bh \)): 20 years
- Sunset (\( Su \)): 40 years

To find the total age of all the listed wines, we sum their ages:
\[
F + C + T + S + O + Cr + Bh + Su = 120 + 40 + 10 + 120 + 20 + 40 + 20 + 40

Calculating the sum:
\[

What is the total number of animals that Josie counted?",1400.0,"To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate the number of each type of animal Josie counted.

1. **Antelopes:**
   Josie counted 80 antelopes.
   \[
   A = 80
   \]

2. **Rabbits:**
   The number of rabbits is 34 more than the number of antelopes.
   \[
   R = A + 34 = 80 + 34 = 114

3. **Hyenas:**
   The number of hyenas is 42 fewer than the total number of antelopes and rabbits combined.
   \[
   H = (A + R) - 42 = (80 + 114) - 42 = 194 - 42 = 152

Ivy collected three times as many blue marbles as Mary. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?",517.0,"Let's break down the information given and solve for each person's collection of marbles step by step.

### Given Information:
- **Jenny**:
  - Red marbles: 30
  - Blue marbles: 25

### Calculations for Each Person:

#### Mary:
- **Red Marbles**: Twice as many as Jenny = \(2 \times 30 = 60\)
- **Blue Marbles**: Half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie

#### Anie:
- **Red Marbles**: 20 more than Mary = \(60 + 20 = 80\)
- **Blue Marbles**: Let's denote this as \(B_A\)

#### Tom:
- **Red Marbles**: Three times as many as Mary = \(3 \times 60 = 180\)
- **Blue Marbles**: 5 fewer than Jenny = \(25 - 5 = 20\)

#### Sara:
- **Red Marbles**: 10 fewer than Anie = \(80 - 10 = 70\)
- **Blue Marbles**: 5 times as many as Mary = \(5 \times 60 = 300\)

#### Leo:
- **Red Marbles**: Three times as many as Jenny = \(3 \times 30 = 90\)
- **Blue Marbles**: Three times as many as Jenny = \(3 \times 25 = 75\)

#### Maya:
- **Red Marbles**: Five times as many as Tom = \(5 \times 180 = 900\)
- **Blue Marbles**: 3 fewer than Sara = \(300 - 3 = 297\)

#### Ivy:
- **Red Marbles**: 2 fewer than Leo = \(90 - 2 = 88\)
- **Blue Marbles**: 3 times as many as Mary = \(3 \times 60 = 180\)

### Total Number of Blue Marbles Collected by All Friends Together:

Now we sum up all the blue marbles collected by each friend:
- Jenny: 25
- Mary: \(B_A\) (we need to find \(B_A\))
- Anie: \(B_A\)
- Tom: 20
- Sara: 300
- Leo: 75
- Maya: 297
- Ivy: 180

Since we know that Anie's blue marbles (\(B_A\)) are equal to Mary's blue marbles, we have:
\[ B_A = 60 \]

So, the total number of blue marbles is:
\[ 25 + 60 + 60 + 20 + 300 + 75 + 297 + 180 \]

Let's add these numbers step by step:
\[ 25 + 60 = 85 \]
\[ 85 + 60 = 145 \]
\[ 145 + 20 = 165 \]
\[ 165 + 300 = 465 \]
\[ 465 + 75 = 540 \]
\[ 540 + 297 = 837 \]
\[ 837 + 180 = 1017 \]

On Sunday she rode as many kilometers as the sum of the kilometers from Monday and Saturday. On Next Monday she rode 60 kilometers. On Next Tuesday she rode 20% more kilometers than Next Monday. How many kilometers did Natalia ride in total?,447.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Natalia rode each day from Monday to Sunday, and then sum these distances.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Monday:**
   - Distance: 40 kilometers

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Distance: 50 kilometers

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Distance: 25 kilometers

4. **Thursday:**
   - Distance: 65 kilometers

5. **Friday:**
   - Distance: 30 kilometers

6. **Saturday:**
   - Distance: 50% fewer kilometers than Thursday
     - Thursday's distance = 65 kilometers
     - 50% of 65 kilometers = \( \frac{50}{100} \times 65 = 32.5 \) kilometers
     - Therefore, Saturday's distance = 65 - 32.5 = 32.5 kilometers

7. **Sunday:**
   - Distance: As many kilometers as the sum of the kilometers from Monday and Saturday
     - Monday's distance = 40 kilometers
     - Saturday's distance = 32.5 kilometers
     - Sum = 40 + 32.5 = 72.5 kilometers

8. **Next Monday:**
   - Distance: 60 kilometers

9. **Next Tuesday:**
   - Distance: 20% more kilometers than Next Monday
     - Next Monday's distance = 60 kilometers
     - 20% of 60 kilometers = \( \frac{20}{100} \times 60 = 12 \) kilometers
     - Therefore, Next Tuesday's distance = 60 + 12 = 72 kilometers

Now, let's sum up all the distances:

\[
\text{Total distance} = 40 + 50 + 25 + 65 + 30 + 32.5 + 72.5 + 60 + 72
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
40 + 50 = 90
\]
\[
90 + 25 = 115
\]
\[
115 + 65 = 180
\]
\[
180 + 30 = 210
\]
\[
210 + 32.5 = 242.5
\]
\[
242.5 + 72.5 = 315
\]
\[
315 + 60 = 375
\]
\[
375 + 72 = 447

If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",546.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pieces of bread and treats each person brings to the zoo based on the given information. We will start with Wanda and work our way through the other individuals.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Wanda's Items:**
   - Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread.
   - Let \( T_W \) be the number of treats Wanda brings.
   - According to the problem, Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane, so \( T_W = \frac{1}{2} T_J \).
   - Also, Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, so \( B_W = 3T_W \).

   Given \( B_W = 90 \):
   \[
   3T_W = 90 \implies T_W = \frac{90}{3} = 30
   \]

2. **Jane's Items:**
   - Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats.
   - Let \( T_J \) be the number of treats Jane brings.
   - Let \( B_J \) be the number of pieces of bread Jane brings.
   - From the problem, \( B_J = 0.75 T_J \).

   Since \( T_W = 30 \), and \( T_W = \frac{1}{2} T_J \):
   \[
   30 = \frac{1}{2} T_J \implies T_J = 60
   \]
   Now, calculate \( B_J \):
   \[
   B_J = 0.75 \times 60 = 45
   \]

3. **Carlos's Items:**
   - Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane.
   - Let \( T_C \) be the number of treats Carlos brings.
   - Let \( B_C \) be the number of pieces of bread Carlos brings.
   - From the problem, \( T_C = \frac{1}{3} T_J \).

   Calculate \( T_C \):
   \[
   T_C = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   Also, Carlos brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats:
   \[
   B_C = 2T_C = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

4. **Mia's Items:**
   - Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda.
   - Let \( T_M \) be the number of treats Mia brings.
   - Let \( B_M \) be the number of pieces of bread Mia brings.
   - From the problem, \( T_M = T_W - 10 \).

   Calculate \( T_M \):
   \[
   T_M = 30 - 10 = 20
   \]
   Also, Mia brings half as many pieces of bread as treats:
   \[
   B_M = \frac{1}{2} T_M = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]

5. **Omar's Items:**
   - Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda.
   - Let \( T_O \) be the number of treats Omar brings.
   - Let \( B_O \) be the number of pieces of bread Omar brings.
   - From the problem, \( T_O = 1.5 T_W \).

   Calculate \( T_O \):
   \[
   T_O = 1.5 \times 30 = 45
   \]
   Also, Omar brings four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats:
   \[
   B_O = \frac{4}{5} T_O = \frac{4}{5} \times 45 = 36
   \]

6. **Priya's Items:**
   - Priya brings twice as many treats as Carlos.
   - Let \( T_P \) be the number of treats Priya brings.
   - Let \( B_P \) be the number of pieces of bread Priya brings.
   - From the problem, \( T_P = 2 T_C \).

   Calculate \( T_P \):
   \[
   T_P = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]
   Also, Priya brings one-fourth as many pieces of bread as treats:
   \[
   B_P = \frac{1}{4} T_P = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
   \]

7. **Elena's Items:**
   - Elena brings 5 more treats than Mia.
   - Let \( T_E \) be the number of treats Elena brings.
   - Let \( B_E \) be the number of pieces of bread Elena brings.
   - From the problem, \( T_E = T_M + 5 \).

   Calculate \( T_E \):
   \[
   T_E = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]
   Also, Elena brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats:
   \[
   B_E = 3 T_E = 3 \times 25 = 75
   \]

### Total Number of Pieces of Bread and Treats:

Summing up all the items:
- Jane: \( B_J = 45 \), \( T_J = 60 \)
- Wanda: \( B_W = 90 \), \( T_W = 30 \)
- Carlos: \( B_C = 40 \), \( T_C = 20 \)
- Mia: \( B_M = 10 \), \( T_M = 20 \)
- Omar: \( B_O = 36 \), \( T_O = 45 \)
- Priya: \( B_P = 10 \), \( T_P = 40 \)
- Elena: \( B_E = 75 \), \( T_E = 25 \)

Total pieces of bread:
\[
B_J + B_W + B_C + B_M + B_O + B_P + B_E = 45 + 90 + 40 + 10 + 36 + 10 + 75 = 296

Let's break down each activity and compute the time spent on each.

1. **Bathing the Dog:**
   Marcus spends 20 minutes giving his dog a bath.

2. **Blow-Drying the Dog:**
   Marcus spends half as long blow-drying his dog as he did bathing her. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Time spent blow-drying} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Brushing the Dog:**
   Marcus spends 8 minutes brushing his dog.

4. **Trimming the Dog’s Nails:**
   Marcus spends half as long trimming his dog’s nails as he did brushing her. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Time spent trimming nails} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Driving to the Trailhead:**
   Marcus drives 9 miles to the trailhead at a speed of 30 miles per hour. The time taken to drive is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{9 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 0.3 \text{ hours} = 0.3 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 18 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Filling the Water Bowl and Giving a Treat:**
   Marcus spends 6 minutes filling his dog’s water bowl and giving her a treat.

7. **Walking the Dog:**
   Marcus walks his dog along a 3-mile trail at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The time taken to walk is:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles/hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} = 0.5 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]

8. **Jogging with the Dog:**
   Marcus then jogs 2 miles with his dog at a speed of 8 miles per hour. The time taken to jog is:

He also saw 12 parrots. He also saw 4 turtles. He also saw 3 scorpions. He is next headed to see the tarantulas. How many tarantulas does he need to see to meet his goal?",115.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs Borgnine has already seen and then determine how many more legs he needs to reach his goal of 1100 legs.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of legs for each animal Borgnine has already seen:

- **Chimps (12 chimps):**
  - Each chimp has 4 legs.
  - Total legs from chimps = \( 12 \times 4 = 48 \) legs.

- **Lions (8 lions):**
  - Each lion has 4 legs.
  - Total legs from lions = \( 8 \times 4 = 32 \) legs.

- **Lizards (5 lizards):**
  - Each lizard has 4 legs.
  - Total legs from lizards = \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) legs.

- **Penguins (8 penguins):**
  - Each penguin has 2 legs.
  - Total legs from penguins = \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \) legs.

- **Elephants (4 elephants):**
  - Each elephant has 4 legs.
  - Total legs from elephants = \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) legs.

- **Parrots (12 parrots):**
  - Each parrot has 2 legs.
  - Total legs from parrots = \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \) legs.

- **Turtles (4 turtles):**
  - Each turtle has 4 legs.
  - Total legs from turtles = \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) legs.

- **Scorpions (3 scorpions):**
  - Each scorpion has 8 legs.
  - Total legs from scorpions = \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \) legs.

### Step 2: Sum up the total number of legs Borgnine has already seen:

\[
48 + 32 + 20 + 16 + 16 + 24 + 16 + 24 = 192 \text{ legs}
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many more legs are needed to reach the goal of 1100 legs:

\[
1100 - 192 = 908 \text{ legs}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of tarantulas needed to meet the goal:

- Let \( x \) be the number of tarantulas Borgnine needs to see.
- Each tarantula has 8 legs.
- Therefore, the equation to find \( x \) is:

\[
8x = 908
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{908}{8} = 113.5
\]

Since Borgnine can't see half a tarantula, he needs to round up to the nearest whole number.

\[
x = 114

5. **Pen Length**: Let the length of the pen be \( P \) cm. According to the problem, the pen is shorter than the pencil by 2 cm.
   \[
   P = 12 \text{ cm} - 2 \text{ cm} = 10 \text{ cm}
   \]

6. **Rubber Length**: Let the length of the rubber be \( R \) cm. According to the problem, the pen is longer than the rubber by 3 cm.
   \[
   P = R + 3 \text{ cm} \implies 10 \text{ cm} = R + 3 \text{ cm} \implies R = 10 \text{ cm} - 3 \text{ cm} = 7 \text{ cm}

They also have a younger brother named Mason who is 1 year younger than Ethan. How old is the youngest brother?,26.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of the three oldest brothers first, and then use that information to find the age of the youngest brother.

### Step 1: Determine the ages of the three oldest brothers

Let's denote the ages of the three oldest brothers as \( x \), \( x+1 \), and \( x+2 \). According to the problem, their ages sum up to 96.

\[
x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 96
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
3x + 3 = 96
\]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[
3x = 93
\]

Divide by 3:

\[
x = 31
\]

So, the ages of the three oldest brothers are:
- Youngest: \( x = 31 \)
- Middle: \( x+1 = 32 \)
- Oldest: \( x+2 = 33 \)

### Step 2: Determine the ages of the younger brothers

Liam is 1 year younger than the youngest of the three oldest brothers:
\[
\text{Liam's age} = 31 - 1 = 30
\]

Noah is 1 year younger than Liam:
\[
\text{Noah's age} = 30 - 1 = 29

Owen is 1 year younger than Noah:
\[
\text{Owen's age} = 29 - 1 = 28
\]

Ethan is 1 year younger than Owen:
\[
\text{Ethan's age} = 28 - 1 = 27
\]

Mason is 1 year younger than Ethan:
\[
\text{Mason's age} = 27 - 1 = 26

How many fruits would she have eaten so far in the two meals?",100.0,"To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the quantities of each type of fruit that Kannon plans to eat over the two meals. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the quantities for last night

- **Apples**: 3
- **Banana**: 1
- **Oranges**: 4
- **Pears**: 2
- **Peaches**: 3
- **Grapes**: 8
- **Plums**: 8 (since she has 1 more plum than the number of bananas she ate last night, and she ate 1 banana)
- **Strawberries**: 10

### Step 2: Calculate the quantities for today based on last night's quantities

- **Apples**: 4 more than last night = \(3 + 4 = 7\)
- **Bananas**: 10 times as many as last night = \(1 \times 10 = 10\)
- **Oranges**: Twice as many as apples she'll have today = \(2 \times 7 = 14\)
- **Pears**: 2 fewer than the number of apples she'll have today = \(7 - 2 = 5\)
- **Peaches**: Three times as many as she ate last night = \(3 \times 3 = 9\)
- **Grapes**: Half as many as the oranges she'll have today = \(\frac{14}{2} = 7\)
- **Plums**: 1 more than the number of bananas she ate last night = \(1 + 1 = 2\)
- **Strawberries**: Twice as many as the pears she'll have today = \(5 \times 2 = 10\)

### Step 3: Sum up all the fruits eaten over the two meals

Now, let's sum up the total number of each type of fruit:

- **Apples**: \(3 + 7 = 10\)
- **Bananas**: \(1 + 10 = 11\)
- **Oranges**: \(4 + 14 = 18\)
- **Pears**: \(2 + 5 = 7\)
- **Peaches**: \(3 + 9 = 12\)
- **Grapes**: \(8 + 7 = 15\)
- **Plums**: \(8 + 2 = 10\)

7. **Kara's Time:**
   - Kara takes one-fourth as long as Jack.
   \[
   \text{Kara's time} = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \text{ hours}

If his farm produced 400 kg of mangoes and he sold the fruits at $50 per kg, calculate the total amount of money he got in that season.",172500.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total produce of each type of fruit and then calculate the total revenue from selling all the fruits at $50 per kg.

Let's denote the total produce of mangoes as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 400 \) kg.

1. **Total produce of apples (\( A \))**:
   - Given: \( A = 2M \)
   - Substituting \( M = 400 \):
     \[
     A = 2 \times 400 = 800 \text{ kg}
     \]

2. **Total produce of oranges (\( O \))**:
   - Given: \( O = M + 200 \)
   - Substituting \( M = 400 \):
     \[
     O = 400 + 200 = 600 \text{ kg}
     \]

3. **Total produce of bananas (\( B \))**:
   - Given: \( B = A - 100 \)
   - Substituting \( A = 800 \):
     \[
     B = 800 - 100 = 700 \text{ kg}
     \]

4. **Total produce of peaches (\( P \))**:
   - Given: \( P = \frac{1}{2}O \)
   - Substituting \( O = 600 \):
     \[
     P = \frac{1}{2} \times 600 = 300 \text{ kg}
     \]

5. **Total produce of guavas (\( G \))**:
   - Given: \( G = \frac{1}{4}O \)
   - Substituting \( O = 600 \):
     \[
     G = \frac{1}{4} \times 600 = 150 \text{ kg}
     \]

6. **Total produce of lemons (\( L \))**:
   - Given: \( L = P + 50 \)
   - Substituting \( P = 300 \):
     \[
     L = 300 + 50 = 350 \text{ kg}
     \]

7. **Total produce of plums (\( Pl \))**:
   - Given: \( Pl = 2G \)
   - Substituting \( G = 150 \):
     \[
     Pl = 2 \times 150 = 300 \text{ kg}
     \]

Now, let's sum up the total produce of all fruits:

\[
\text{Total produce} = M + A + O + B + P + G + L + Pl
\]
Substituting the values we have calculated:
\[
\text{Total produce} = 400 + 800 + 600 + 700 + 300 + 150 + 350 + 300
\]

Adding these together:
\[
\text{Total produce} = 400 + 800 + 600 + 700 + 300 + 150 + 350 + 300 = 3700 \text{ kg}
\]

Finally, we calculate the total revenue from selling all the fruits at $50 per kg:
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 3700 \text{ kg} \times 50 \text{ dollars/kg} = 185000 \text{ dollars}

1. **Lions**: 100
2. **Snakes**: Half as many as lions, so \( \frac{100}{2} = 50 \)
3. **Giraffes**: 10 fewer than snakes, so \( 50 - 10 = 40 \)
4. **Zebras**: Twice as many as giraffes, so \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \)

He buys 5 peacocks that cost 50% less each than a pony. He buys 3 kangaroos that cost 20% more each than a zebra. How much did he spend?",13830.0,"Let's break down the costs step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of goats
Tim buys 3 goats at $400 each.
\[
\text{Cost of goats} = 3 \times 400 = 1200
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number and cost of llamas
Tim buys twice as many llamas as goats, so he buys \(2 \times 3 = 6\) llamas.
The cost of each llama is 50% more than a goat, so each llama costs \(400 \times 1.5 = 600\).
\[
\text{Cost of llamas} = 6 \times 600 = 3600
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number and cost of alpacas
Each alpaca costs 25% less than a llama, so each alpaca costs \(600 \times 0.75 = 450\).
Tim buys 4 alpacas.
\[
\text{Cost of alpacas} = 4 \times 450 = 1800
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of zebras
Tim buys 2 zebras, and each zebra costs twice as much as a goat, so each zebra costs \(400 \times 2 = 800\).
\[
\text{Cost of zebras} = 2 \times 800 = 1600
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the number and cost of ponies
Tim buys as many ponies as goats, so he buys 3 ponies.
Each pony costs $100 more than a goat, so each pony costs \(400 + 100 = 500\).
\[
\text{Cost of ponies} = 3 \times 500 = 1500
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the number and cost of peacocks
Tim buys 5 peacocks, and each peacock costs 50% less than a pony, so each peacock costs \(500 \times 0.5 = 250\).
\[
\text{Cost of peacocks} = 5 \times 250 = 1250
\]

### Step 7: Calculate the number and cost of kangaroos
Tim buys 3 kangaroos, and each kangaroo costs 20% more than a zebra, so each kangaroo costs \(800 \times 1.2 = 960\).
\[
\text{Cost of kangaroos} = 3 \times 960 = 2880

Under the same conditions, the use of two sails while carrying extra cargo brings her ship to the speed of 40 knots, and she sails for 1 hour using two sails with the extra cargo. Under the same conditions, the use of one sail with a favorable current brings her ship to the speed of 30 knots, and she sails for 2 hours with that setup. what is the total distance, in land miles, that she will travel?",759.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each scenario and then sum these distances.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Speeds and Distances with One Sail:**
   - Speed with one sail: 25 knots
   - Time with one sail: 4 hours
   - Distance with one sail: \( \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 25 \text{ knots} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 100 \text{ nautical miles} \)

2. **Speeds and Distances with Two Sails:**
   - Speed with two sails: 50 knots
   - Time with two sails: 4 hours
   - Distance with two sails: \( \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \text{ knots} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ nautical miles} \)

3. **Speeds and Distances with Three Sails:**
   - Speed with three sails: 60 knots
   - Time with three sails: 1 hour
   - Distance with three sails: \( \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \text{ knots} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ nautical miles} \)

4. **Speeds and Distances with Four Sails:**
   - Speed with four sails: 70 knots
   - Time with four sails: 2 hours
   - Distance with four sails: \( \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 70 \text{ knots} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ nautical miles} \)

5. **Speeds and Distances with One Reefed Sail:**
   - Speed with one reefed sail: 15 knots
   - Time with one reefed sail: 4 hours
   - Distance with one reefed sail: \( \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 15 \text{ knots} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ nautical miles} \)

6. **Speeds and Distances with Two Sails and Extra Cargo:**
   - Speed with two sails and extra cargo: 40 knots
   - Time with two sails and extra cargo: 1 hour
   - Distance with two sails and extra cargo: \( \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 40 \text{ knots} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 40 \text{ nautical miles} \)

7. **Speeds and Distances with One Sail and Favorable Current:**
   - Speed with one sail and favorable current: 30 knots
   - Time with one sail and favorable current: 2 hours
   - Distance with one sail and favorable current: \( \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \text{ knots} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ nautical miles} \)

### Summing Up All Distances:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Total Distance} &= 100 \text{ nautical miles} + 200 \text{ nautical miles} + 60 \text{ nautical miles} + 140 \text{ nautical miles} \\
&\quad + 60 \text{ nautical miles} + 40 \text{ nautical miles} + 60 \text{ nautical miles} \\
&= 660 \text{ nautical miles}
\end{align*}
\]

### Converting Nautical Miles to Land Miles:

Since 1 nautical mile = 1.15 land miles,

\[
\text{Total Distance in Land Miles} = 660 \text{ nautical miles} \times 1.15 \text{ land miles/nautical mile} = 759 \text{ land miles}

He needs to know how many pieces to cut the lasagna into to serve it. Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Another friend, Nora, is picky and will only eat one-third of what Manny eats, and Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. Another friend, Ben, will eat the same amount of lasagna as Kai. Another friend, Tina, loves lasagna and will eat 3 pieces. Another friend, Omar, will eat half as much as Kai. Another friend, Zoe, will eat one more piece of lasagna than Manny. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",15.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of lasagna pieces that will be consumed by all the friends. Let's break down the consumption of each person:

1. **Manny**: He will eat 1 piece.
2. **Aaron**: He won't eat any lasagna.
3. **Kai**: He will eat twice as much as Manny, so he will eat \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pieces.
4. **Raphael**: He will eat half as much as Manny, so he will eat \(0.5 \times 1 = 0.5\) pieces.
5. **Lisa**: She will eat 2 pieces plus any leftover from Raphael. Since Raphael eats 0.5 pieces, she will eat \(2 + (0.5 - 0) = 2.5\) pieces (assuming Raphael finishes his piece completely).
6. **Nora**: She will eat one-third of what Manny eats, so she will eat \(\frac{1}{3} \times 1 = \frac{1}{3}\) piece.
7. **Ben**: He will eat the same amount as Kai, so he will eat 2 pieces.
8. **Tina**: She will eat whatever is left after everyone else. We'll calculate the remaining pieces after everyone else eats.
9. **Omar**: He will eat half as much as Kai, so he will eat \(0.5 \times 2 = 1\) piece.
10. **Zoe**: She will eat one more piece than Manny, so she will eat \(1 + 1 = 2\) pieces.

Now, let's sum up the pieces eaten by each person:

- Manny: 1 piece
- Aaron: 0 pieces
- Kai: 2 pieces
- Raphael: 0.5 pieces
- Lisa: 2.5 pieces
- Nora: \(\frac{1}{3}\) piece
- Ben: 2 pieces
- Tina: Remaining pieces after everyone else
- Omar: 1 piece
- Zoe: 2 pieces

First, let's calculate the total pieces eaten by those who have already been accounted for:

\[
1 + 0 + 2 + 0.5 + 2.5 + \frac{1}{3} + 2 + 1 + 2 = 10.8333 \text{ pieces}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many pieces are left for Tina. The total number of pieces needed must be an integer, so we round up to the nearest whole number since partial pieces can't be served. Therefore, we need to ensure the total number of pieces is at least 11.

Let's verify the calculation again:

\[
1 + 0 + 2 + 0.5 + 2.5 + \frac{1}{3} + 2 + 1 + 2 = 10.8333
\]

Since 10.8333 is not an integer, we round up to the next whole number, which is 11.

   - Each spider has 8 legs.
   - Monroe has 8 spiders.
   - Total legs from spiders = \( 8 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs/spider} = 64 \text{ legs} \).

2. **Ants:**
   - Each ant has 6 legs.
   - Monroe has 12 ants.
   - Total legs from ants = \( 12 \text{ ants} \times 6 \text{ legs/ant} = 72 \text{ legs} \).

3. **Beetles:**
   - Each beetle has 6 legs.
   - Monroe has 5 beetles.
   - Total legs from beetles = \( 5 \text{ beetles} \times 6 \text{ legs/beetle} = 30 \text{ legs} \).

4. **Scorpions:**
   - Each scorpion has 8 legs.
   - Monroe has 3 scorpions.
   - Total legs from scorpions = \( 3 \text{ scorpions} \times 8 \text{ legs/scorpion} = 24 \text{ legs} \).

5. **Crickets:**
   - Each cricket has 6 legs.
   - Monroe has 10 crickets.
   - Total legs from crickets = \( 10 \text{ crickets} \times 6 \text{ legs/cricket} = 60 \text{ legs} \).

6. **Crabs:**
   - Each crab has 8 legs.
   - Monroe has 2 crabs.
   - Total legs from crabs = \( 2 \text{ crabs} \times 8 \text{ legs/crab} = 16 \text{ legs} \).

7. **Ladybugs:**
   - Each ladybug has 6 legs.
   - Monroe has 7 ladybugs.
   - Total legs from ladybugs = \( 7 \text{ ladybugs} \times 6 \text{ legs/ladybug} = 42 \text{ legs} \).

### Summing Up All Legs:
Now, we add up all the legs from each type of creature:
\[
64 \text{ (spiders)} + 72 \text{ (ants)} + 30 \text{ (beetles)} + 24 \text{ (scorpions)} + 60 \text{ (crickets)} + 16 \text{ (crabs)} + 42 \text{ (ladybugs)}
\]

Let's perform the addition step-by-step:
\[
64 + 72 = 136
\]
\[
136 + 30 = 166
\]
\[
166 + 24 = 190
\]
\[
190 + 60 = 250
\]
\[
250 + 16 = 266
\]
\[
266 + 42 = 308
\]

### Final Answer:

For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs. The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs. The machine has twice as many orange gumballs as blue gumballs. The machine has one-fourth as many pink gumballs as green gumballs. The machine has as many white gumballs as the total number of yellow and blue gumballs combined. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",117.0,"Let's denote the number of red gumballs as \( R \). According to the problem, we have:

- \( R = 16 \)
- The number of blue gumballs is half the number of red gumballs: \( B = \frac{R}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \)
- The number of green gumballs is 4 times the number of blue gumballs: \( G = 4B = 4 \times 8 = 32 \)
- The number of yellow gumballs is equal to the number of blue gumballs: \( Y = B = 8 \)
- The number of purple gumballs is 3 fewer than the number of red gumballs: \( P = R - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \)
- The number of orange gumballs is twice the number of blue gumballs: \( O = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \)
- The number of pink gumballs is one-fourth the number of green gumballs: \( Pk = \frac{G}{4} = \frac{32}{4} = 8 \)
- The number of white gumballs is equal to the total number of yellow and blue gumballs combined: \( W = Y + B = 8 + 8 = 16 \)

Now, let's sum up all the gumballs:

\[
R + B + G + Y + P + O + Pk + W = 16 + 8 + 32 + 8 + 13 + 16 + 8 + 16
\]

Adding these together:

\[
16 + 8 = 24 \\
24 + 32 = 56 \\
56 + 8 = 64 \\
64 + 13 = 77 \\
77 + 16 = 93 \\
93 + 8 = 101 \\
101 + 16 = 117
\]

Therefore, the total number of gumballs in the machine is:
