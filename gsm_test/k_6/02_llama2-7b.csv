* There are 40 red candies.
* There are 20 fewer yellow candies than three times as many red candies. So, if there are x red candies, there are 3x - 20 yellow candies.
* Half as many blue candies as yellow candies. So, if there are x yellow candies, there are 5x - 10 blue candies.
* Half as many green candies as red candies. So, if there are x red candies, there are x/2 green candies.
* There are 10 fewer than five times as many purple candies as yellow candies. So, if there are x yellow candies, there are 5x - 10 purple candies.
* One-fifth as many orange candies as yellow candies. So, if there are x yellow candies, there are x/5 orange candies.

2. There were 34 more rabbits than antelopes. So, the total number of rabbits is 80 + 34 = 114.
3. There were 42 fewer hyenas than the total number of antelopes and rabbits combined. So, the total number of hyenas is 114 - 42 = 72.
4. There were 50 more wild dogs than hyenas. So, the total number of wild dogs is 72 + 50 = 122.
5. The number of leopards was half the number of rabbits. So, the total number of leopards is 114 / 2 = 57.
6. There were twice as many zebras as leopards. So, the total number of zebras is 57 x 2 = 114.
7. There were 3 fewer giraffes than zebras. So, the total number of giraffes is 114 - 3 = 111.
8. There were half as many buffaloes as antelopes and rabbits combined. So, the total number of buffaloes is 111 / 2 = 55.
9. There were two-thirds as many monkeys as rabbits and leopards combined. So, the total number of monkeys is 55 / 2 = 27.
10. There were 5 more elephants than the total number of wild dogs and hyenas combined. So, the total number of elephants is 122 + 5 = 127.
11. There were 2 more hippos than one-fifth as many antelopes. So, the total number of hippos is 111 / 5 = 22.

Now, let's add up the total number of animals that Josie counted:

80 antelopes + 114 rabbits + 72 hyenas + 122 wild dogs + 57 leopards + 114 zebras + 111 giraffes + 55 buffaloes + 27 monkeys + 127 elephants + 22 hippos = 805

How many fish do they have in total?,179.0," To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the problem to find the number of fish each person has, and then add them up to find the total number of fish.

1. Micah has 7 fish in his aquarium.
2. Kenneth has three times as many fish as Micah, so Kenneth has 7 x 3 = 21 fish in his aquarium.
3. Matthias has 15 fewer fish than Kenneth, so Matthias has 21 - 15 = 6 fish in his aquarium.
4. Noah has 7 times as many fish as Micah, so Noah has 7 x 7 = 49 fish in his aquarium.
5. Liam has 5 fewer fish than Kenneth, so Liam has 21 - 5 = 16 fish in his aquarium.
6. Owen has 3 times as many fish as Matthias, so Owen has 3 x 6 = 18 fish in his aquarium.
7. Ethan has 10 fewer fish than Owen, so Ethan has 18 - 10 = 8 fish in his aquarium.
8. Ava has 4 times as many fish as Micah, so Ava has 4 x 7 = 28 fish in her aquarium.
9. Sophia has 2 fewer fish than Ava, so Sophia has 28 - 2 = 26 fish in her aquarium.

Now, let's add up the number of fish each person has:

Micah: 7
Kenneth: 21
Matthias: 6
Noah: 49
Liam: 16

* Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats, so if she brings x pieces of bread, she brings 75% of x treats.
* Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane, so she brings x/2 treats.
* Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane, so he brings (3/5)x treats.
* Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda, so she brings x - 10 treats.

Let's start by using the information given in the passage to find the number of rehabilitation centers visited by each person:

* Han visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude did, so Han visited 2/3 as many centers as Jude did.
* Jude visited half as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa did, so Jude visited 1/2 as many centers as Lisa did.
* Omar visited 3 more rehabilitation centers than Jude did, so Omar visited 3 + 1 = 4 more centers than Jude did.
* Priya visited 1 less than three times as many rehabilitation centers as Han did, so Priya visited 3/4 as many centers as Han did.
* Chen visited twice as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa did, so Chen visited 2 x 2 = 4 more centers than Lisa did.
* Nia visited 4 fewer than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jane did, so Nia visited 2/3 as many centers as Jane did.
* Luis visited 5 more than half as many rehabilitation centers as Nia did, so Luis visited 5 + 1/2 = 6 more centers than Nia did.
* Tasha visited 2 fewer than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Omar did, so Tasha visited 2/3 as many centers as Omar did.

Now, let's add up the total number of rehabilitation centers visited by all the people:

Here's the information given in the problem:

1. Marcus spends 20 minutes giving his dog a bath and half as long blow-drying her.
2. After the bath, Marcus spends 8 minutes brushing his dog.
3. He then spends half as long trimming her nails as he spent brushing her.
4. Before the walk, Marcus drives 9 miles to the trailhead at 30 miles per hour.
5. At the trailhead, he spends 6 minutes filling her water bowl and giving her a treat.

7. After the walk, he jogs 2 miles with her at 8 miles per hour.
8. When they get home, he spends 10 minutes cleaning up muddy paw prints.

Now, let's calculate the total time Marcus spends with his dog:

1. Bath and blow-drying: 20 + 8 = 28 minutes
2. Brushing: 8 minutes
3. Nail trimming: half of 8 = 4 minutes
4. Driving to the trailhead: 9 miles x 30 miles/hour = 270 minutes (4.5 hours)
5. Time at the trailhead: 6 minutes + 6 minutes = 12 minutes
6. Walk: 3 miles x 6 miles/hour = 18 minutes (not including the time Marcus spends jogging with the dog)
7. Jogging: 2 miles x 8 miles/hour = 16 minutes
8. Cleaning up muddy paw prints: 10 minutes

Adding up all these times gives us the total time Marcus spends with his dog:

How many tarantulas does he need to see to meet his goal?",111.0," To determine how many tarantulas Borgnine needs to see to meet his goal of 1100 legs at the zoo, we need to subtract the number of legs he has already seen from his goal.

Borgnine has already seen:

* 12 chimps (24 legs)
* 8 lions (32 legs)
* 5 lizards (20 legs)
* 8 penguins (0 legs)
* 6 elephants (60 legs)
* 12 parrots (48 legs)
* 4 turtles (48 legs)
* 3 scorpions (0 legs)

A paintbrush is 3 centimeters longer than the pen. A stylus is half as long as the ruler. A paperclip chain is 4 centimeters shorter than the stylus. what is the total length of the rubber, the pen, the pencil, and all the other stationery items mentioned altogether?",104.0," To solve this problem, we need to find the length of each stationery item and then add them up. Here are the measurements given in the problem:

* The pen is longer than the rubber by 3 centimeters, so the length of the pen is 3 + x centimeters, where x is the length of the rubber.
* The pen is shorter than the pencil by 2 centimeters, so the length of the pencil is x + 2 centimeters.
* The marker is 1 centimeter longer than the pencil, so the length of the marker is x + 1 centimeter.
* The crayon is 2 centimeters shorter than the rubber, so the length of the crayon is x - 2 centimeters.
* The ruler is twice as long as the pencil, so the length of the ruler is 2x centimeters.
* The paintbrush is 3 centimeters longer than the pen, so the length of the paintbrush is x + 3 centimeters.
* The stylus is half as long as the ruler, so the length of the stylus is x / 2 centimeters.
* The paperclip chain is 4 centimeters shorter than the stylus, so the length of the paperclip chain is x - 4 centimeters.

Now, let's add up the lengths of all the stationery items:

The length of the rubber is x centimeters.
The length of the pen is 3 + x centimeters.
The length of the pencil is x + 2 centimeters.
The length of the marker is x + 1 centimeter.
The length of the crayon is x - 2 centimeters.
The length of the ruler is 2x centimeters.
The length of the paintbrush is x + 3 centimeters.
The length of the stylus is x / 2 centimeters.
The length of the paperclip chain is x - 4 centimeters.

So, the total length of all the stationery items is:

3 + x + x + x + x + 2x + (x + 3) + (x / 2) + (x - 4) = 3x + 7x + 2x + 2x + 2x + x + 3 + 1 = 15x + 13x + 2x + 2x + 2x + 3 = 35x

They also have a younger brother named Liam who is 1 year younger than the youngest of the three oldest brothers. They also have a younger brother named Noah who is 1 year younger than Liam. They also have a younger brother named Owen who is 1 year younger than Noah. They also have a younger brother named Ethan who is 1 year younger than Owen. They also have a younger brother named Mason who is 1 year younger than Ethan. They also have a younger brother named Lucas who is 1 year younger than Mason. How old is the youngest brother?,25.0," To solve this problem, we can use the information given in the problem to create a system of linear equations. Let's assume the ages of the three oldest brothers are x, x + 1, and x + 2, respectively. Since their sum is 96, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 96

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x + 3 = 96

Now, we are given that Liam is 1 year younger than the youngest of the three oldest brothers. So, the age of Liam is x + 1.

We are also given that Noah is 1 year younger than Liam, so the age of Noah is x + 2.

We are also given that Owen is 1 year younger than Noah, so the age of Owen is x + 3.

We are also given that Ethan is 1 year younger than Owen, so the age of Ethan is x + 4.

We are also given that Mason is 1 year younger than Ethan, so the age of Mason is x + 5.

We are also given that Lucas is 1 year younger than Mason, so the age of Lucas is x + 6.

Now, we can find the age of the youngest brother, Liam, by subtracting the age of the oldest brother from the total age of the brothers:

96 = x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + (x + 3) + (x + 4) + (x + 5) + (x + 6)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

96 = 7x + 6

Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get:

89 = 7x

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:

x = 12

Therefore, the youngest brother is 12 years old.

From the problem, we know that:

* Last night, Kannon had 3 apples, a banana, and 4 oranges for dinner.
* Today, she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, and twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today.

1. Emma can run all around two arenas in 20 hours, so it takes her 20 hours to run all around the two arenas.
2. Fernando takes twice as long as Emma to run his course, so it takes him 40 hours to run all around the two arenas (2 x 20 = 40).
3. Gina takes half as long as Fernando to run all around the two arenas, so it takes her 20 hours to run all around the two arenas (20 / 2 = 10).
4. Harold takes 10 hours more than Emma to run all around the two arenas, so it takes him 30 hours to run all around the two arenas (30 = 20 + 10).
5. Ivy takes 5 hours less than Fernando to run all around the two arenas, so it takes her 15 hours to run all around the two arenas (15 = 20 - 5).
6. Jack takes three times as long as Gina to run all around the two arenas, so it takes him 30 hours to run all around the two arenas (30 = 10 x 3).
7. Kara takes one-fourth as long as Jack to run all around the two arenas, so it takes her 7.5 hours to run all around the two arenas (7.5 = 30 / 4).

Let's start by using the information that the total produce of apples was twice the total produce of mangoes:

Apples: 2x = 200 kg
Mangoes: x = 100 kg

Next, we are told that the total produce of oranges was 200 kg more than that of mangoes:

Oranges: x + 200 = 300 kg

We are also given that the total produce of peaches was half the total produce of oranges:

Peaches: x/2 = 150 kg

From here, we can use the information that he produced 100 kg fewer bananas than apples:

Bananas: x - 100 = 300 kg

We are also told that he harvested one-fourth as many guavas as mangoes:

Guavas: x/4 = 25 kg

Finally, we are given that the total produce of lemons was 50 kg more than the total produce of peaches:

Lemons: x + 50 = 200 kg

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Mr. Sergio got from selling his fruits at $50 per kg:

Total amount = x(50) + x(50) + x(50) + ... + x(50)

where x is the total produce of each fruit in kg.

We can simplify the calculation by using the fact that the total produce of all fruits is equal to the total amount of money Mr. Sergio got:

Total amount = 400 kg(50) + 200 kg(50) + 150 kg(50) + 25 kg(50) + 100 kg(50) + 50 kg(50) = 1500 kg(50) = $75,000

Under optimal wind conditions, the use of two sails brings the ship to the speed of 50 knots, whereas under the same conditions, the use of one sail brings her ship to the speed of 25 knots. A knot is a nautical term for speed equal to 1 nautical mile per hour, and one nautical mile equals 1.15 land miles. If she travels in her sailboat under optimal wind conditions for 4 hours with one sail and then for another 4 hours with two sails, Under the same conditions, the use of three sails brings the ship to the speed of 60 knots, and she sails for 1 hour using three sails.

Under the same conditions, sailing with one reefed sail brings her ship to the speed of 15 knots, and she sails for 4 hours with a reefed sail. Under the same conditions, the use of two sails while carrying extra cargo brings her ship to the speed of 40 knots, and she sails for 1 hour using two sails with the extra cargo. Under the same conditions, the use of one sail with a favorable current brings her ship to the speed of 30 knots, and she sails for 2 hours with that setup. Under the same conditions, if she lowers all sails and just drifts, her ship moves at 5 knots, and she drifts for 4 hours. what is the total distance, in land miles, that she will travel?",782.0," To solve this problem, we need to use the given information to find the speeds at which Buffy sails under different conditions, and then use those speeds to calculate the total distance traveled.

1. Under optimal wind conditions, the use of two sails brings the ship to the speed of 50 knots, and she sails for 4 hours. So, the distance traveled with two sails is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 50 knots x 4 hours = 200 nautical miles

2. Under optimal wind conditions, the use of one sail brings the ship to the speed of 25 knots, and she sails for 4 hours. So, the distance traveled with one sail is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 25 knots x 4 hours = 100 nautical miles

3. Under optimal wind conditions, the use of three sails brings the ship to the speed of 60 knots, and she sails for 1 hour. So, the distance traveled with three sails is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 60 knots x 1 hour = 60 nautical miles

4. Under optimal wind conditions, the use of four sails brings the ship to the speed of 70 knots, and she sails for 2 hours. So, the distance traveled with four sails is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 70 knots x 2 hours = 140 nautical miles

5. Under optimal wind conditions, sailing with one reefed sail brings the ship to the speed of 15 knots, and she sails for 4 hours. So, the distance traveled with one reefed sail is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 15 knots x 4 hours = 60 nautical miles

6. Under optimal wind conditions, the use of two sails while carrying extra cargo brings the ship to the speed of 40 knots, and she sails for 1 hour. So, the distance traveled with two sails and extra cargo is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 40 knots x 1 hour = 40 nautical miles

7. Under optimal wind conditions, the use of one sail with a favorable current brings the ship to the speed of 30 knots, and she sails for 2 hours. So, the distance traveled with one sail and a favorable current is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 30 knots x 2 hours = 60 nautical miles

8. Under optimal wind conditions, if she lowers all sails and just drifts, her ship moves at 5 knots, and she drifts for 4 hours. So, the distance traveled while drifting is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 5 knots x 4 hours = 20 nautical miles

Now, let's add up all the distances traveled under different conditions to find the total distance traveled by Buffy:

Total distance = Distance with two sails + Distance with one sail + Distance with three sails + Distance with four sails + Distance with reefed sail + Distance with extra cargo + Distance drifting
= 200 nautical miles + 100 nautical miles + 60 nautical miles + 140 nautical miles + 60 nautical miles + 40 nautical miles + 20 nautical miles

How much is Peter's remaining money?",310.0," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of all the items Peter bought and then subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money he carried.

Cost of potatoes = 6 kilos x $2 per kilo = $12
Cost of tomatoes = 9 kilos x $3 per kilo = $27
Cost of cucumbers = 5 kilos x $4 per kilo = $20
Cost of bananas = 3 kilos x $5 per kilo = $15
Cost of rice = 4 kilos x $6 per kilo = $24
Cost of onions = 2 kilos x $3 per kilo = $6
Cost of apples = 5 kilos x $4 per kilo = $20
Cost of chicken = 3 kilos x $8 per kilo = $24
Cost of bread = 10 loaves x $2 each = $20
Cost of olive oil = 2 bottles x $11 each = $22

Total cost = $12 + $27 + $20 + $15 + $24 + $6 + $20 + $24 + $20 + $22 = $188

6. Ben - Same as Kai
7. Tina - 3 pieces
8. Omar - Half as much as Kai
9. Zoe - One more piece than Manny
10. Gus - One-fourth of Manny's amount

Total amount of lasagna eaten by the group:

Aaron: 0 pieces
Kai: 2 * 2 = 4 pieces
Raphael: 0.5 * 1 = 0.5 pieces
Lisa: 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 pieces
Nora: 1/3 * 1 = 0.33 pieces
Ben: 4 pieces
Tina: 3 pieces
Omar: 0.5 * 2 = 1 piece
Zoe: 1 + 1 = 2 pieces
Gus: 1/4 * 1 = 0.25 pieces

Now, to determine how many pieces Manny should cut his lasagna into, we need to subtract the total amount of lasagna eaten by the group from the total amount of lasagna Manny made:

Manny made: 1 piece
Total amount eaten by group: 4 + 4 + 0.5 + 2 + 0.33 + 4 + 1 + 0.5 + 2 = 19.5 pieces
