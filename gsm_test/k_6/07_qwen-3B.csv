### Given Information:
- For every 1 minute Carlotta sings, she spends:
  - 3 minutes practicing
  - 5 minutes throwing tantrums
  - 1 minute warm-up
  - 2 minutes costume changes
  - 3 minutes meet-and-greet
  - 2 minutes vocal coaching
  - 7 minutes travel time

- The final stage performance is 6 minutes long.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Time Spent Singing:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent singing} = 6 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Time Spent Practicing:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent practicing} = 3 \times \text{Time spent singing} = 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Time Spent Throwing Tantrums:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent throwing tantrums} = 5 \times \text{Time spent singing} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Time Spent Warm-Up:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent warm-up} = 1 \times \text{Time spent singing} = 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ minutes}

6. **Time Spent Interviews:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent interviews} = 1 \times \text{Time spent singing} = 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ minutes}

7. **Time Spent Meet-and-Greet:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent meet-and-greet} = 3 \times \text{Time spent singing} = 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ minutes}
   \]

8. **Time Spent Vocal Coaching:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent vocal coaching} = 2 \times \text{Time spent singing} = 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ minutes}
   \]

9. **Time Spent Travel Time:**
   \[
   \text{Time spent travel time} = 7 \times \text{Time spent singing} = 7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Total Combined Time:
Now, we sum all the individual times calculated above:
\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time spent singing} + \text{Time spent practicing} + \text{Time spent throwing tantrums} + \text{Time spent warm-up} + \text{Time spent costume changes} + \text{Time spent interviews} + \text{Time spent meet-and-greet} + \text{Time spent vocal coaching} + \text{Time spent travel time}
\]
\[
\text{Total time} = 6 + 18 + 30 + 6 + 12 + 6 + 18 + 12 + 42

Let's break down the information given:

1. **Insulin Pills**: 2 pills per day.
2. **Blood Pressure Pills**: 3 pills per day.
3. **Anticonvulsants**: Twice as many as blood pressure pills, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pills per day.
4. **Vitamin C**: As many as insulin pills, so 2 pills per day.
5. **Cholesterol**: Twice as many as blood pressure pills, so \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pills per day.
6. **Allergy**: As many as anticonvulsants pills, so 6 pills per day.
7. **Thyroid**: As many as cholesterol pills, so 6 pills per day.
8. **Probiotic**: As many as insulin pills, so 2 pills per day.
9. **Iron**: Twice as many as probiotic pills, so \(2 \times 2 = 4\) pills per day.

Now, let's sum up the total number of pills Holly takes each day:

- 1 yogurt: $0.60
- 1 cheese stick: $0.40
- 1 banana: $0.25

Summing these costs:
\[
\text{Cost per student} = 2.10 + 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.30 + 0.50 + 0.75 + 0.60 + 0.40 + 0.25 = 5.90

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost for all students.
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Number of students} \times \text{Cost per student} = 370 \times 5.90

There were 40 red candies, 20 less than three times as many yellow candies as red candies, and half as many blue candies as yellow candies. There were also half as many green candies as red candies. There were also 10 less than five times as many purple candies as yellow candies. There were also one-fifth as many orange candies as yellow candies. There were also four times as many brown candies as blue candies. There were also three-quarters as many pink candies as brown candies. There were also 2 less than three times as many teal candies as brown candies. If Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, how many candies remained?",1568.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each type of candy and then calculate the total remaining after Carlos eats all the yellow candies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Red Candies:**
   - Given: \( R = 40 \)

2. **Yellow Candies:**
   - Given: Yellow candies are 20 less than three times as many as red candies.
   - Let \( Y \) be the number of yellow candies.
   - Therefore, \( Y = 3R - 20 \).
   - Substituting \( R = 40 \):
     \[
     Y = 3(40) - 20 = 120 - 20 = 100
     \]

3. **Blue Candies:**
   - Given: Blue candies are half as many as yellow candies.
   - Let \( B \) be the number of blue candies.
   - Therefore, \( B = \frac{Y}{2} \).
   - Substituting \( Y = 100 \):
     \[
     B = \frac{100}{2} = 50
     \]

4. **Green Candies:**
   - Given: Green candies are half as many as red candies.
   - Let \( G \) be the number of green candies.
   - Therefore, \( G = \frac{R}{2} \).
   - Substituting \( R = 40 \):
     \[
     G = \frac{40}{2} = 20
     \]

5. **Purple Candies:**
   - Given: Purple candies are 10 less than five times as many as yellow candies.
   - Let \( P \) be the number of purple candies.
   - Therefore, \( P = 5Y - 10 \).
   - Substituting \( Y = 100 \):
     \[
     P = 5(100) - 10 = 500 - 10 = 490
     \]

6. **Orange Candies:**
   - Given: Orange candies are one-fifth as many as yellow candies.
   - Let \( O \) be the number of orange candies.
   - Therefore, \( O = \frac{Y}{5} \).
   - Substituting \( Y = 100 \):
     \[
     O = \frac{100}{5} = 20
     \]

7. **Brown Candies:**
   - Given: Brown candies are four times as many as blue candies.
   - Let \( B_{\text{brown}} \) be the number of brown candies.
   - Therefore, \( B_{\text{brown}} = 4B \).
   - Substituting \( B = 50 \):
     \[
     B_{\text{brown}} = 4(50) = 200
     \]

8. **Pink Candies:**
   - Given: Pink candies are three-quarters as many as brown candies.
   - Let \( P_{\text{pink}} \) be the number of pink candies.
   - Therefore, \( P_{\text{pink}} = \frac{3}{4}B_{\text{brown}} \).
   - Substituting \( B_{\text{brown}} = 200 \):
     \[
     P_{\text{pink}} = \frac{3}{4}(200) = 150
     \]

9. **Teal Candies:**
   - Given: Teal candies are four times as many as brown candies.
   - Let \( T \) be the number of teal candies.
   - Therefore, \( T = 4B_{\text{brown}} \).
   - Substituting \( B_{\text{brown}} = 200 \):
     \[
     T = 4(200) = 800
     \]

### Total Number of Candies Initially:
\[
R + Y + B + G + P + O + B_{\text{brown}} + P_{\text{pink}} + T = 40 + 100 + 50 + 20 + 490 + 20 + 200 + 150 + 800
\]
\[

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Living Room Walls:**
   - Area: 600 square feet

2. **Bedroom Walls:**
   - Each bedroom wall takes up 400 square feet.
   - Number of bedrooms: 3
   - Total area for bedroom walls: \( 400 \text{ sq ft/bedroom} \times 3 \text{ bedrooms} = 1200 \text{ sq ft} \)

3. **Kitchen Walls:**
   - Each kitchen wall takes up 500 square feet.
   - Number of kitchens: 6
   - Total area for kitchen walls: \( 500 \text{ sq ft/kitchen} \times 6 \text{ kitchens} = 3000 \text{ sq ft} \)

4. **Dining Room Walls:**
   - Each dining room wall takes up 240 square feet.
   - Number of dining rooms: 5
   - Total area for dining room walls: \( 240 \text{ sq ft/dining room} \times 5 \text{ dining rooms} = 1200 \text{ sq ft} \)

5. **Bathroom Walls:**
   - Each bathroom wall takes up 150 square feet.
   - Number of bathrooms: 8
   - Total area for bathroom walls: \( 150 \text{ sq ft/bathroom} \times 8 \text{ bathrooms} = 1200 \text{ sq ft} \)

6. **Garage Walls:**
   - Each garage wall takes up 480 square feet.
   - Number of garages: 5
   - Total area for garage walls: \( 480 \text{ sq ft/garage} \times 5 \text{ garages} = 2400 \text{ sq ft} \)

7. **Hallway Walls:**
   - Each hallway wall takes up 900 square feet.
   - Number of hallways: 8
   - Total area for hallway walls: \( 900 \text{ sq ft/hallway} \times 8 \text{ hallways} = 7200 \text{ sq ft} \)

8. **Sunroom Walls:**
   - Each sunroom wall takes up 300 square feet.
   - Number of sunrooms: 6
   - Total area for sunroom walls: \( 300 \text{ sq ft/sunroom} \times 6 \text{ sunrooms} = 1800 \text{ sq ft} \)

### Summing Up All Wall Areas:
\[
600 \text{ sq ft (living room)} + 1200 \text{ sq ft (bedroom walls)} + 3000 \text{ sq ft (kitchen walls)} + 1200 \text{ sq ft (dining room walls)} + 1200 \text{ sq ft (bathroom walls)} + 2400 \text{ sq ft (garage walls)} + 7200 \text{ sq ft (hallway walls)} + 1800 \text{ sq ft (sunroom walls)}
\]

\[
= 600 + 1200 + 3000 + 1200 + 1200 + 2400 + 7200 + 1800 = 16600 \text{ sq ft}
\]

### Calculating Paint Needed:
One gallon of paint covers 600 square feet. To find out how many gallons are needed, divide the total wall area by the coverage per gallon:

\[
\frac{16600 \text{ sq ft}}{600 \text{ sq ft/gallon}} = 27.6667 \text{ gallons}

There were also two-thirds as many monkeys as rabbits and leopards combined. There were also 5 more elephants than the total number of wild dogs and hyenas combined. There were also 2 more hippos than one-fifth as many antelopes. What is the total number of animals that Josie counted?",1418.0,"To solve this problem, we will calculate the number of each type of animal Josie counted and then sum them up.

1. **Antelopes:**
   \[
   A = 80
   \]

2. **Rabbits:**
   \[
   R = A + 34 = 80 + 34 = 114
   \]

3. **Hyenas:**
   The total number of antelopes and rabbits combined is:
   \[
   A + R = 80 + 114 = 194
   \]
   Therefore, the number of hyenas is:
   \[
   H = 194 - 42 = 152

4. **Wild Dogs:**
   \[
   W = H + 50 = 152 + 50 = 202

5. **Leopards:**
   \[
   L = \frac{R}{2} = \frac{114}{2} = 57

   \[
   Z = 2L = 2 \times 57 = 114

8. **Buffaloes:**
   The total number of antelopes and rabbits combined is:
   \[

9. **Monkeys:**
   The total number of rabbits and leopards combined is:
   \[
   R + L = 114 + 57 = 171
   \]
   Therefore, the number of monkeys is:
   \[
   M = \frac{R + L}{2} = \frac{171}{2} = 85.5
   \]
   Since the number of animals must be an integer, let's recheck the calculations or assumptions. However, given the context, it seems there might be a rounding issue or a need for precise integer values. For now, we'll proceed with the given numbers.

10. **Elephants:**
    The total number of wild dogs and hyenas combined is:
    \[
    W + H = 202 + 152 = 354
    \]
    Therefore, the number of elephants is:
    \[
    E = \frac{W + H}{2} = \frac{354}{2} = 177
    \]

11. **Hippos:**
    One-fifth the number of antelopes is:
    \[
    \frac{A}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = 16
    \]
    Therefore, the number of hippos is:
    \[
    H' = 16 + 2 = 18
    \]

Now, we sum up all the animals:

\[
\text{Total number of animals} = A + R + H + W + L + Z + G + B + M + E + H'
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total number of animals} = 80 + 114 + 152 + 202 + 57 + 114 + 111 + 97 + 85.5 + 177 + 18
\]

Adding these values:

\[
80 + 114 = 194
\]
\[
194 + 152 = 346
\]
\[
346 + 202 = 548
\]
\[
548 + 57 = 605
\]
\[
605 + 114 = 719
\]
\[
719 + 111 = 830
\]
\[
830 + 97 = 927
\]
\[
927 + 85.5 = 1012.5
\]
\[
1012.5 + 177 = 1189.5

\[
1189.5 + 18 = 1207.5

7. **Ethan's Fish:**
   - Ethan has 10 fewer fish than Owen.
   \[
   E = O - 10 = 18 - 10 = 8
   \]

8. **Ava's Fish:**
   - Ava has 4 times as many fish as Micah.
   \[
   A = 4 \times M = 4 \times 7 = 28
   \]

9. **Sophia's Fish:**
   - Sophia has 2 fewer fish than Ava.
   \[
   S = A - 2 = 28 - 2 = 26
   \]

Now, we sum up all the fish:

\[
M + K + Th + N + L + O + E + A + S = 7 + 21 + 6 + 49 + 16 + 18 + 8 + 28 + 26
\]

Let's add these numbers step by step:

\[

\[
28 + 6 = 34
\]
\[
34 + 49 = 83
\]
\[
83 + 16 = 99
\]
\[
99 + 18 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 8 = 125
\]
\[
125 + 28 = 153
\]
\[
153 + 26 = 179

If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?",767.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red and blue marbles collected by each person based on the given relationships and the initial information about Jenny's collection.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Jenny's Collection:**
   - Red marbles: 30
   - Blue marbles: 25

2. **Mary's Collection:**
   - Let \( M_r \) be the number of red marbles Mary collected.
   - Let \( M_b \) be the number of blue marbles Mary collected.
   - According to the problem, \( M_r = 2 \times 30 = 60 \).
   - Anie collected \( A_r = M_r + 20 = 60 + 20 = 80 \) red marbles.
   - Mary collected half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, so \( M_b = \frac{A_b}{2} \).

3. **Anie's Collection:**
   - Let \( A_b \) be the number of blue marbles Anie collected.
   - Since \( A_r = 80 \), we have \( A_b = 2 \times 25 = 50 \).
   - Therefore, \( M_b = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \).

4. **Tom's Collection:**
   - Let \( T_r \) be the number of red marbles Tom collected.
   - Let \( T_b \) be the number of blue marbles Tom collected.
   - According to the problem, \( T_r = 3 \times 60 = 180 \).
   - Tom collected 5 fewer blue marbles than Jenny, so \( T_b = 25 - 5 = 20 \).

5. **Sara's Collection:**
   - Let \( S_r \) be the number of red marbles Sara collected.
   - Let \( S_b \) be the number of blue marbles Sara collected.
   - According to the problem, \( S_r = 10 \) fewer than Anie, so \( S_r = 80 - 10 = 70 \).
   - Sara collected 5 times as many blue marbles as Mary, so \( S_b = 5 \times 25 = 125 \).

6. **Leo's Collection:**
   - Let \( L_r \) be the number of red marbles Leo collected.
   - Let \( L_b \) be the number of blue marbles Leo collected.
   - According to the problem, \( L_r = 3 \times 60 = 180 \).
   - Leo collected 3 times as many blue marbles as Jenny, so \( L_b = 3 \times 25 = 75 \).

7. **Maya's Collection:**
   - Let \( M_a_r \) be the number of red marbles Maya collected.
   - Let \( M_a_b \) be the number of blue marbles Maya collected.
   - According to the problem, \( M_a_r = 5 \times 180 = 900 \).
   - Maya collected 3 fewer blue marbles than Sara, so \( M_a_b = 125 - 3 = 122 \).

8. **Ivy's Collection:**
   - Let \( I_r \) be the number of red marbles Ivy collected.
   - Let \( I_b \) be the number of blue marbles Ivy collected.
   - According to the problem, \( I_r = 2 \) fewer than Leo, so \( I_r = 180 - 2 = 178 \).
   - Ivy collected 3 times as many blue marbles as Mary, so \( I_b = 3 \times 25 = 75 \).

9. **Zane's Collection:**
   - Let \( Z_r \) be the number of red marbles Zane collected.
   - Let \( Z_b \) be the number of blue marbles Zane collected.
   - According to the problem, \( Z_r = 3 \times 60 = 180 \).
   - Zane collected 5 times as many blue marbles as Anie, so \( Z_b = 5 \times 50 = 250 \).

### Total Number of Blue Marbles Collected by All Friends Together:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Total blue marbles} &= J_b + M_b + A_b + T_b + S_b + L_b + M_a_b + I_b + Z_b \\

On Next Wednesday she rode as many kilometers as the sum of the kilometers from Friday and Tuesday. How many kilometers did Natalia ride in total?,527.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of kilometers Natalia rode each day from Monday to Sunday, and then sum these distances.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Monday:**
   - Natalia rode 40 kilometers.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Natalia rode 50 kilometers.

3. **Wednesday:**
   - Natalia rode 25 kilometers.

4. **Thursday:**
   - Natalia rode 65 kilometers.

5. **Friday:**
   - Natalia rode 30 kilometers.

6. **Saturday:**
   - Natalia rode 50% fewer kilometers than Thursday.
     - Thursday's distance = 65 kilometers.
     - 50% of 65 kilometers = \( 0.5 \times 65 = 32.5 \) kilometers.
     - Therefore, Saturday's distance = \( 65 - 32.5 = 32.5 \) kilometers.

7. **Sunday:**
   - Natalia rode as many kilometers as the sum of the kilometers from Friday and Tuesday.
     - Friday's distance = 30 kilometers.
     - Tuesday's distance = 50 kilometers.
     - Sum = \( 30 + 50 = 80 \) kilometers.
     - Therefore, Sunday's distance = 80 kilometers.

8. **Next Monday:**
   - Natalia rode 60 kilometers.

9. **Next Tuesday:**
   - Natalia rode 20% more kilometers than Next Monday.
     - Next Monday's distance = 60 kilometers.
     - 20% of 60 kilometers = \( 0.2 \times 60 = 12 \) kilometers.
     - Therefore, Next Tuesday's distance = \( 60 + 12 = 72 \) kilometers.

10. **Next Wednesday:**
    - Natalia rode as many kilometers as the sum of the kilometers from Friday and Tuesday.
      - Friday's distance = 30 kilometers.
      - Tuesday's distance = 50 kilometers.
      - Sum = \( 30 + 50 = 80 \) kilometers.
      - Therefore, Next Wednesday's distance = 80 kilometers.

### Total Distance Calculation:

Now, we sum up all the distances:

\[
\begin{align*}

Ben brings half as many treats as Jane and three-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats. If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",594.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of treats and pieces of bread each person brings to the zoo based on the given information. We will start with Wanda and work our way through the rest.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Determine Wanda's items:**
   - Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread.
   - Let \( T_W \) be the number of treats Wanda brings.
   - According to the problem, Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane, so \( T_W = \frac{1}{2} T_J \).
   - Also, Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, so \( B_W = 3 T_W \).

   Given \( B_W = 90 \):
   \[
   3 T_W = 90 \implies T_W = \frac{90}{3} = 30
   \]

2. **Determine Jane's items:**
   - \( T_J = 2 T_W = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
   - Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats, so \( B_J = 0.75 T_J \).
   \[
   B_J = 0.75 \times 60 = 45
   \]

3. **Determine Carlos's items:**
   - Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane, so \( T_C = \frac{1}{3} T_J \).
   \[
   T_C = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   - Carlos brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats, so \( B_C = 2 T_C \).
   \[
   B_C = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

4. **Determine Mia's items:**
   - Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda, so \( T_M = T_W - 10 \).
   \[
   T_M = 30 - 10 = 20
   \]
   - Mia brings half as many pieces of bread as treats, so \( B_M = \frac{1}{2} T_M \).
   \[
   B_M = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]

5. **Determine Omar's items:**
   - Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda, so \( T_O = 1.5 T_W \).
   \[
   T_O = 1.5 \times 30 = 45
   \]
   - Omar brings four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats, so \( B_O = \frac{4}{5} T_O \).
   \[
   B_O = \frac{4}{5} \times 45 = 36
   \]

6. **Determine Priya's items:**
   - Priya brings twice as many treats as Carlos, so \( T_P = 2 T_C \).
   \[
   T_P = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]
   - Priya brings one-fourth as many pieces of bread as treats, so \( B_P = \frac{1}{4} T_P \).
   \[
   B_P = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
   \]

7. **Determine Elena's items:**
   - Elena brings 5 more treats than Mia, so \( T_E = T_M + 5 \).
   \[
   T_E = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]
   - Elena brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, so \( B_E = 3 T_E \).
   \[
   B_E = 3 \times 25 = 75
   \]

8. **Determine Ben's items:**
   - Ben brings half as many treats as Jane, so \( T_B = \frac{1}{2} T_J \).
   \[
   T_B = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30
   \]
   - Ben brings three-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats, so \( B_B = \frac{3}{5} T_B \).
   \[
   B_B = \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18
   \]

### Total Number of Items

Now, sum up all the pieces of bread and treats:

- **Total pieces of bread:**
  \[
  B_J + B_W + B_C + B_M + B_O + B_P + B_E + B_B = 45 + 90 + 40 + 10 + 36 + 10 + 75 + 18 = 334
  \]

- **Total treats:**
  \[
  T_J + T_W + T_C + T_M + T_O + T_P + T_E + T_B = 60 + 30 + 20 + 20 + 45 + 40 + 25 + 30 = 260

How many tarantulas does he need to see to meet his goal?",111.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs Borgnine has already seen and then determine how many more legs he needs to reach his goal of 1100 legs.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of legs for each animal Borgnine has already seen:

- **Chimps (12 chimps):**
  - Each chimp has 2 legs.
  - Total legs from chimps = \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \)

- **Lions (8 lions):**
  - Each lion has 4 legs.
  - Total legs from lions = \( 8 \times 4 = 32 \)

- **Lizards (5 lizards):**
  - Each lizard has 4 legs.
  - Total legs from lizards = \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \)

- **Penguins (8 penguins):**
  - Each penguin has 2 legs.
  - Total legs from penguins = \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \)

- **Elephants (6 elephants):**
  - Each elephant has 4 legs.
  - Total legs from elephants = \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \)

- **Parrots (12 parrots):**
  - Each parrot has 2 legs.
  - Total legs from parrots = \( 12 \times 2 = 24 \)

- **Turtles (4 turtles):**
  - Each turtle has 4 legs.
  - Total legs from turtles = \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \)

- **Scorpions (3 scorpions):**
  - Each scorpion has 8 legs.
  - Total legs from scorpions = \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \)

- **Frogs (8 frogs):**
  - Each frog has 4 legs.
  - Total legs from frogs = \( 8 \times 4 = 32 \)

- **Tarantulas (unknown number):**
  - Let's denote the number of tarantulas as \( T \).
  - Each tarantula has 8 legs.
  - Total legs from tarantulas = \( 8T \)

### Step 2: Sum up all the legs Borgnine has already seen:

\[
24 \text{ (chimps)} + 32 \text{ (lions)} + 20 \text{ (lizards)} + 16 \text{ (penguins)} + 24 \text{ (elephants)} + 24 \text{ (parrots)} + 16 \text{ (turtles)} + 24 \text{ (scorpions)} + 32 \text{ (frogs)} + 8T \text{ (tarantulas)}

\[
= 24 + 32 + 20 + 16 + 24 + 24 + 16 + 24 + 32 + 8T
\]

\[
= 192 + 8T
\]

### Step 3: Determine the number of tarantulas needed to reach 1100 legs:

We know that Borgnine wants to see a total of 1100 legs. Therefore, we set up the equation:

\[
192 + 8T = 1100
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( T \):

Subtract 192 from both sides of the equation:

\[
8T = 1100 - 192
\]

\[
8T = 908
\]

Divide both sides by 8:

\[
T = \frac{908}{8}
\]

\[
T = 113.5

Let's denote the ages of the three oldest brothers as \( x \), \( x+1 \), and \( x+2 \). According to the problem, their ages sum up to 96:

\[
x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 96

Combine like terms:

\[
3x + 3 = 96

- Middle: \( x+1 = 32 \)
- Oldest: \( x+2 = 33 \)

### Step 2: Determine the ages of the younger brothers

Liam is 1 year younger than the youngest of the three oldest brothers:
\[
\text{Liam's age} = 31 - 1 = 30
\]

Noah is 1 year younger than Liam:
\[
\text{Noah's age} = 30 - 1 = 29
\]

Owen is 1 year younger than Noah:
\[
\text{Owen's age} = 29 - 1 = 28
\]

Ethan is 1 year younger than Owen:
\[
\text{Ethan's age} = 28 - 1 = 27

Mason is 1 year younger than Ethan:
\[
\text{Mason's age} = 27 - 1 = 26

Lucas is 1 year younger than Mason:
\[
\text{Lucas's age} = 26 - 1 = 25

Today she is planning to have 3 fewer kiwis than the total number of apples and bananas she'll have today. How many fruits would she have eaten so far in the two meals?",118.0,"To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the quantities of each fruit that Kannon plans to eat over the two meals. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the quantities for last night

- **Apples**: 3
- **Banana**: 1
- **Oranges**: 4
- **Pears**: 2
- **Peaches**: 3
- **Grapes**: 8
- **Plums**: 5
- **Strawberries**: 10
- **Kiwis**: 4

### Step 2: Calculate the quantities for today based on last night's consumption

#### Apples
Today she plans to have 4 more apples than last night:
\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \]

#### Bananas
Today she plans to have 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night:
\[ 1 \times 10 = 10 \]

#### Oranges
Today she plans to have twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today:

Ivy takes 5 hours less than Fernando to run all around the two arenas. Jack takes three times as long as Gina to run all around the two arenas. Kara takes one-fourth as long as Jack to run all around the two arenas. Luis takes 2 hours more than Kara to run all around the two arenas. what's the total time it takes everyone mentioned to run all around the two arenas?",237.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the time each person takes to run all around the two arenas and then sum these times.

Let's denote the time it takes Emma to run all around the two arenas as \( E \).

Given:
- Emma takes \( E = 20 \) hours.

Next, we calculate the time for each person based on the given relationships:

1. **Fernando**:
   - It takes Fernando twice as long as Emma.
   - Therefore, \( F = 2E = 2 \times 20 = 40 \) hours.

2. **Gina**:
   - Gina takes half as long as Fernando.
   - Therefore, \( G = \frac{F}{2} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) hours.

3. **Harold**:
   - Harold takes 10 hours more than Emma.
   - Therefore, \( H = E + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \) hours.

4. **Ivy**:
   - Ivy takes 5 hours less than Fernando.
   - Therefore, \( I = F - 5 = 40 - 5 = 35 \) hours.

5. **Jack**:
   - Jack takes three times as long as Gina.
   - Therefore, \( J = 3G = 3 \times 20 = 60 \) hours.

6. **Kara**:
   - Kara takes one-fourth as long as Jack.
   - Therefore, \( K = \frac{J}{4} = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) hours.

7. **Luis**:
   - Luis takes 2 hours more than Kara.
   - Therefore, \( L = K + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17 \) hours.

Now, we sum the times for all individuals to find the total time:

\[
E + F + G + H + I + J + K + L = 20 + 40 + 20 + 30 + 35 + 60 + 15 + 17
\]

Adding these values step-by-step:

\[
20 + 40 = 60
\]
\[
60 + 20 = 80
\]
\[
80 + 30 = 110

\[
110 + 35 = 145

\[
205 + 15 = 220

Let's denote the total produce of mangoes as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 400 \) kg.

1. **Total produce of apples (\( A \))**:
   - Given: \( A = 2M \)
   - Substituting \( M = 400 \):
     \[
     A = 2 \times 400 = 800 \text{ kg}
     \]

2. **Total produce of oranges (\( O \))**:
   - Given: \( O = M + 200 \)
   - Substituting \( M = 400 \):
     \[
     O = 400 + 200 = 600 \text{ kg}
     \]

3. **Total produce of bananas (\( B \))**:
   - Given: \( B = A - 100 \)
   - Substituting \( A = 800 \):
     \[
     B = 800 - 100 = 700 \text{ kg}
     \]

4. **Total produce of peaches (\( P \))**:
   - Given: \( P = \frac{1}{2}O \)
   - Substituting \( O = 600 \):
     \[
     P = \frac{1}{2} \times 600 = 300 \text{ kg}
     \]

5. **Total produce of guavas (\( G \))**:
   - Given: \( G = \frac{1}{4}O \)
   - Substituting \( O = 600 \):
     \[
     G = \frac{1}{4} \times 600 = 150 \text{ kg}
     \]

6. **Total produce of lemons (\( L \))**:
   - Given: \( L = P + 50 \)
   - Substituting \( P = 300 \):
     \[
     L = 300 + 50 = 350 \text{ kg}
     \]

7. **Total produce of plums (\( Pl \))**:
   - Given: \( Pl = 2G \)
   - Substituting \( G = 150 \):
     \[
     Pl = 2 \times 150 = 300 \text{ kg}
     \]

8. **Total produce of cherries (\( Ch \))**:
   - Given: \( Ch = O - 150 \)
   - Substituting \( O = 600 \):
     \[
     Ch = 600 - 150 = 450 \text{ kg}
     \]

Now, let's sum up the total produce of all fruits:
\[
\text{Total produce} = M + A + O + B + P + G + L + Pl + Ch
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Total produce} = 400 + 800 + 600 + 700 + 300 + 150 + 350 + 300 + 450
\]

Calculating the sum:
\[
400 + 800 = 1200
\]
\[
1200 + 600 = 1800
\]
\[
1800 + 700 = 2500
\]
\[
2500 + 300 = 2800
\]
\[
2800 + 150 = 2950
\]
\[
2950 + 350 = 3300
\]
\[
3300 + 300 = 3600
\]
\[
3600 + 450 = 4050
\]

So, the total produce is 4050 kg.

Finally, we calculate the total revenue by multiplying the total produce by the price per kg ($50):
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 4050 \times 50 = 202500

There is also an annual maintenance fee of $600 per person. Each person also pays $50 per month for gym access. The family buys 2 guest passes each month at $30 each. There is a one-time processing fee of $500 for the whole family. They rent lockers for 3 of the members at $120 per locker for the year. They spend $200 every quarter on club events for the family. John agrees to pay half the total cost for the whole family. How much does John pay for the first year?,35590.0,"To determine how much John pays for the first year, we need to calculate the total costs for the family and then find out what half of that amount is.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Joining Fee:**
   - There are 4 people (John + 3 family members).
   - Joining fee per person = $4000.
   - Total joining fee = \( 4 \times 4000 = \$16000 \).

2. **Monthly Costs:**
   - Monthly cost per person = $1000.
   - Annual maintenance fee per person = $600.
   - Gym access per person per month = $50.
   - Guest pass per person per month = 2 passes at $30 each = $60.
   - Lockers rental per person per year = 3 lockers at $120 each = $360.
   - Club events per person per quarter = $200.

   Let's calculate the total monthly cost for one person:
   \[
   \text{Total monthly cost} = 1000 + 600 + 50 + 60 + 120 + 200 = \$1830
   \]

   Now, let's calculate the annual cost for one person:
   \[
   \text{Annual cost} = 1830 \times 12 = \$21960
   \]

   For 4 people:
   \[
   \text{Total annual cost} = 4 \times 21960 = \$87840
   \]

3. **One-Time Processing Fee:**
   - One-time processing fee for the whole family = $500.

4. **Quarterly Club Events:**
   - Club events per person per quarter = $200.
   - For 4 people:
   \[
   \text{Total quarterly cost} = 4 \times 200 = \$800
   \]
   - For 4 quarters:
   \[
   \text{Total yearly cost} = 4 \times 800 = \$3200
   \]

5. **Total Cost for the Family:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Joining fee} + \text{Annual cost} + \text{One-time processing fee} + \text{Quarterly club events}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 16000 + 87840 + 500 + 3200 = \$107540
   \]

6. **John's Share:**
   - John agrees to pay half of the total cost.
   \[
   \text{John's share} = \frac{107540}{2} = \$53770

Savanna National park has 10 fewer monkeys than its zebras. Safari National park also has one-fifth as many crocodiles as lions. Savanna National park has twice as many crocodiles as Safari National park. Safari National park also has 10 fewer flamingos than giraffes. Savanna National park has three times as many flamingos as Safari National park. Safari National park also has as many hippos as elephants. Savanna National park has 5 more hippos than its crocodiles. How many animals in total does Savanna National park have?",840.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each type of animal in both Safari and Savanna National parks, and then sum up the total number of animals in Savanna National park.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the number of animals in Safari National Park

1. **Lions**: 100
2. **Snakes**: Half as many as lions = \( \frac{100}{2} = 50 \)
3. **Giraffes**: 10 fewer than snakes = \( 50 - 10 = 40 \)
4. **Zebras**: Twice as many as giraffes = \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \)
5. **Elephants**: 5 fewer than snakes = \( 50 - 5 = 45 \)
6. **Monkeys**: Three times as many as giraffes = \( 3 \times 40 = 120 \)
7. **Crocodiles**: One-fifth as many as lions = \( \frac{100}{5} = 20 \)
8. **Flamingos**: 10 fewer than giraffes = \( 40 - 10 = 30 \)
9. **Hippos**: As many as elephants = 45

#### Step 2: Calculate the total number of animals in Safari National Park

\[
\text{Total in Safari} = 100 (\text{lions}) + 50 (\text{snakes}) + 40 (\text{giraffes}) + 80 (\text{zebras}) + 45 (\text{elephants}) + 120 (\text{monkeys}) + 20 (\text{crocodiles}) + 30 (\text{flamingos}) + 45 (\text{hippos})
\]

\[
\text{Total in Safari} = 100 + 50 + 40 + 80 + 45 + 120 + 20 + 30 + 45 = 520
\]

#### Step 3: Determine the number of animals in Savanna National Park

1. **Lions**: Double as many as Safari = \( 2 \times 100 = 200 \)
2. **Snakes**: Triple as many as Safari = \( 3 \times 50 = 150 \)
3. **Giraffes**: 20 more than Safari = \( 40 + 20 = 60 \)
4. **Zebras**: Half as many as lions = \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \)
5. **Elephants**: 20 more than Safari = \( 45 + 20 = 65 \)
6. **Monkeys**: 10 fewer than zebras = \( 100 - 10 = 90 \)
7. **Crocodiles**: Twice as many as Safari = \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \)
8. **Flamingos**: 3 times as many as giraffes = \( 3 \times 60 = 180 \)
9. **Hippos**: 5 more than crocodiles = \( 40 + 5 = 45 \)

#### Step 4: Calculate the total number of animals in Savanna National Park

\[
\text{Total in Savanna} = 200 (\text{lions}) + 150 (\text{snakes}) + 60 (\text{giraffes}) + 100 (\text{zebras}) + 65 (\text{elephants}) + 90 (\text{monkeys}) + 40 (\text{crocodiles}) + 180 (\text{flamingos}) + 45 (\text{hippos})
\]

\[
\text{Total in Savanna} = 200 + 150 + 60 + 100 + 65 + 90 + 40 + 180 + 45 = 830

7,qwen-3B,Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct,6,39,38,"Tim decides to get animals for his zoo. He buys 3 goats for $400 each. He gets twice as many llamas which cost 50% more each. He also buys 4 alpacas that cost 25% less each than a llama. He buys 2 zebras that cost twice as much as a goat each. He buys as many ponies as goats, and each pony costs $100 more than a goat. He buys 5 peacocks that cost 50% less each than a pony. He buys 3 kangaroos that cost 20% more each than a zebra. He buys 8 rabbits for $75 each. How much did he spend?",14430.0,"Let's break down the costs step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of goats
Tim buys 3 goats at $400 each.
\[
\text{Cost of goats} = 3 \times 400 = 1200
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number and cost of llamas
Tim buys twice as many llamas as goats, so he buys \(2 \times 3 = 6\) llamas.
The cost of each llama is 50% more than a goat, so each llama costs \(400 \times 1.5 = 600\).
\[
\text{Cost of llamas} = 6 \times 600 = 3600
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number and cost of alpacas
Tim buys 4 alpacas, and each alpaca costs 25% less than a llama. So each alpaca costs \(600 \times 0.75 = 450\).
\[
\text{Cost of alpacas} = 4 \times 450 = 1800
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of zebras
Tim buys 2 zebras, and each zebra costs twice as much as a goat. So each zebra costs \(400 \times 2 = 800\).
\[
\text{Cost of zebras} = 2 \times 800 = 1600
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the number and cost of ponies
Tim buys as many ponies as goats, so he buys 3 ponies. Each pony costs $100 more than a goat, so each pony costs \(400 + 100 = 500\).
\[
\text{Cost of ponies} = 3 \times 500 = 1500
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the number and cost of peacocks
Tim buys 5 peacocks, and each peacock costs 50% less than a pony. So each peacock costs \(500 \times 0.5 = 250\).
\[
\text{Cost of peacocks} = 5 \times 250 = 1250
\]

### Step 7: Calculate the number and cost of kangaroos
Tim buys 3 kangaroos, and each kangaroo costs 20% more than a zebra. So each kangaroo costs \(800 \times 1.2 = 960\).
\[
\text{Cost of kangaroos} = 3 \times 960 = 2880
\]

### Step 8: Calculate the number and cost of rabbits
Tim buys 8 rabbits at $75 each.
\[
\text{Cost of rabbits} = 8 \times 75 = 600
\]

### Step 9: Sum up all the costs
Now we sum up all the individual costs:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 1200 + 3600 + 1800 + 1600 + 1500 + 1250 + 2880 + 600 = 13430

Finally, Hector the hopping hare stands on his back legs for three times as long as Wally. What is the combined length of time, in minutes, that all the entertainers mentioned stand on their back legs?",116.0,"To solve this problem, we will break it down step by step and calculate the time each entertainer stands on their back legs.

1. **Pulsar's Time:**
   - Pulsar stands on his back legs for 10 minutes.
   \[
   T_{\text{Pulsar}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Polly's Time:**
   - Polly stands on her back legs for three times as long as Pulsar.
   \[
   T_{\text{Polly}} = 3 \times T_{\text{Pulsar}} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Petra's Time:**
   - Petra stands on her back legs for one-sixth as long as Polly.
   \[
   T_{\text{Petra}} = \frac{T_{\text{Polly}}}{6} = \frac{30}{6} = 5 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Marvin the Monkey's Time:**
   - Marvin stands on his back legs for half as long as Polly.
   \[
   T_{\text{Marvin}} = \frac{T_{\text{Polly}}}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Zelda the Zebra's Time:**
   - Zelda stands on her back legs for 4 minutes more than Pulsar.
   \[
   T_{\text{Zelda}} = T_{\text{Pulsar}} + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Trixie the Tiny Tiger's Time:**
   - Trixie stands on her back legs for twice as long as Petra.
   \[
   T_{\text{Trixie}} = 2 \times T_{\text{Petra}} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]

7. **Wally the Walrus's Time:**
   - Wally stands on his back legs for one-third as long as Marvin.
   \[
   T_{\text{Wally}} = \frac{T_{\text{Marvin}}}{3} = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ minutes}
   \]

8. **Greta the Giraffe's Time:**
   - Greta stands on her back legs for 2 minutes less than Zelda.
   \[
   T_{\text{Greta}} = T_{\text{Zelda}} - 2 = 14 - 2 = 12 \text{ minutes}
   \]

9. **Hector the Hare's Time:**
   - Hector stands on his back legs for three times as long as Wally.
   \[
   T_{\text{Hector}} = 3 \times T_{\text{Wally}} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, we sum up the times for all the entertainers:

\[
T_{\text{total}} = T_{\text{Pulsar}} + T_{\text{Polly}} + T_{\text{Petra}} + T_{\text{Marvin}} + T_{\text{Zelda}} + T_{\text{Trixie}} + T_{\text{Wally}} + T_{\text{Greta}} + T_{\text{Hector}}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
T_{\text{total}} = 10 + 30 + 5 + 15 + 14 + 10 + 5 + 12 + 15
\]

Adding these together:

\[
T_{\text{total}} = 10 + 30 = 40
\]
\[
40 + 5 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 15 = 60
\]
\[
60 + 14 = 74
\]
\[
74 + 10 = 84
\]
\[
84 + 5 = 89
\]
\[
89 + 12 = 101

\[
101 + 15 = 116

Under the same conditions, if she lowers all sails and just drifts, her ship moves at 5 knots, and she drifts for 4 hours. what is the total distance, in land miles, that she will travel?",782.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance traveled under each condition and then sum these distances.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Speeds and Distances with One Sail:**
   - Speed with one sail: 25 knots
   - Time with one sail: 4 hours
   - Distance with one sail: \( \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 25 \text{ knots} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 100 \text{ nautical miles} \)

2. **Speeds and Distances with Two Sails:**
   - Speed with two sails: 50 knots
   - Time with two sails: 4 hours
   - Distance with two sails: \( \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \text{ knots} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ nautical miles} \)

3. **Speeds and Distances with Three Sails:**
   - Speed with three sails: 60 knots
   - Time with three sails: 1 hour
   - Distance with three sails: \( \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \text{ knots} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ nautical miles} \)

4. **Speeds and Distances with Four Sails:**
   - Speed with four sails: 70 knots
   - Time with four sails: 2 hours
   - Distance with four sails: \( \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 70 \text{ knots} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 140 \text{ nautical miles} \)

5. **Speeds and Distances with One Reefed Sail:**
   - Speed with one reefed sail: 15 knots
   - Time with one reefed sail: 4 hours
   - Distance with one reefed sail: \( \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 15 \text{ knots} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ nautical miles} \)

6. **Speeds and Distances with Two Sails and Extra Cargo:**
   - Speed with two sails and extra cargo: 40 knots
   - Time with two sails and extra cargo: 1 hour
   - Distance with two sails and extra cargo: \( \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 40 \text{ knots} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 40 \text{ nautical miles} \)

7. **Speeds and Distances with One Sail and Favorable Current:**
   - Speed with one sail and favorable current: 30 knots
   - Time with one sail and favorable current: 2 hours
   - Distance with one sail and favorable current: \( \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \text{ knots} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ nautical miles} \)

8. **Speeds and Distances Drifting:**
   - Speed while drifting: 5 knots
   - Time drifting: 4 hours
   - Distance drifting: \( \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 5 \text{ knots} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ nautical miles} \)

### Summing Up All Distances:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Total Distance} &= 100 + 200 + 60 + 140 + 60 + 40 + 60 + 20 \\
&= 620 \text{ nautical miles}
\end{align*}
\]

### Converting Nautical Miles to Land Miles:

Since 1 nautical mile = 1.15 land miles,

\[
\text{Total Distance in Land Miles} = 620 \text{ nautical miles} \times 1.15 \text{ land miles/nautical mile} = 703 \text{ land miles}

10. **Omar**:
    - Omar will eat half as much as Kai.
    - Omar's consumption: \( M \) pieces.

11. **Zoe**:
    - Zoe will eat one more piece than Manny.
    - Zoe's consumption: \( M + 1 \) pieces.

12. **Gus**:
    - Gus will eat one-fourth of what Manny eats.
    - Gus's consumption: \( \frac{M}{4} \) pieces.
    - After Gus eats, Kai will eat whatever is left of his piece.
    - Kai's remaining piece after Gus: \( 2M - \frac{M}{4} = \frac{8M}{4} - \frac{M}{4} = \frac{7M}{4} \).
    - Since Kai will eat this remaining piece, we need to ensure that the total pieces eaten do not exceed the total pieces available.

Now, let's sum up all the pieces:

\[
M + 0 + 2M + \frac{M}{2} + 2 + \frac{M}{3} + \left(2 - \frac{M}{3}\right) + 2M + 3 + M + (M + 1) + \frac{M}{4} + \frac{7M}{4}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
M + 2M + \frac{M}{2} + 2 + 2 + 3 + M + M + 1 + \frac{M}{4} + \frac{7M}{4}
\]

\[
= 7M + \frac{M}{2} + \frac{M}{4} + \frac{7M}{4} + 8
\]

Convert all terms to have a common denominator of 4:

\[
= 7M + \frac{2M}{4} + \frac{M}{4} + \frac{7M}{4} + 8
\]

Combine the \( M \) terms:

\[
= 7M + \frac{2M + M + 7M}{4} + 8
\]

\[
= 7M + \frac{10M}{4} + 8
\]

\[
= 7M + \frac{5M}{2} + 8
\]

Convert \( 7M \) to a fraction with a denominator of 2:

\[
= \frac{14M}{2} + \frac{5M}{2} + 8
\]

Combine the fractions:

\[
= \frac{19M}{2} + 8
\]

Since the total number of pieces must be an integer, we need to find \( M \) such that \( \frac{19M}{2} + 8 \) is an integer. This implies \( \frac{19M}{2} \) must be an integer, so \( M \) must be even. Let's test \( M = 2 \):

\[
\frac{19 \times 2}{2} + 8 = 19 + 8 = 27
\]

Thus, \( M = 2 \) works. Therefore, Manny should cut the lasagna into:

   - White men's t-shirts: $20
   - Black men's t-shirts: $18
   - Blue men's t-shirts: $22
   - Red men's t-shirts: $21
   - Green men's t-shirts: $19
   - Gray men's t-shirts: $17
   - Yellow men's t-shirts: $16
   - Purple men's t-shirts: $23

2. **Determine the price for women's t-shirts:**
   - Women's t-shirts are $5 cheaper than men's t-shirts of the same color.
   - Therefore, the prices for women's t-shirts will be:
     - White women's t-shirts: $20 - $5 = $15
     - Black women's t-shirts: $18 - $5 = $13
     - Blue women's t-shirts: $22 - $5 = $17
     - Red women's t-shirts: $21 - $5 = $16
     - Green women's t-shirts: $19 - $5 = $14
     - Gray women's t-shirts: $17 - $5 = $12
     - Yellow women's t-shirts: $16 - $5 = $11
     - Purple women's t-shirts: $23 - $5 = $18

3. **Calculate the total cost for one sector:**
   - Each sector has 10 men and 10 women.
   - Total number of employees per sector: \(10 \text{ (men)} + 10 \text{ (women)} = 20 \text{ employees}\).

4. **Calculate the total cost for all sectors:**
   - There are 8 sectors.
   - Total number of employees: \(8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ employees}\).

5. **Sum up the costs for each color of t-shirts:**

     - Men: \(10 \times 22 = 220\)
     - Women: \(10 \times 17 = 170\)
     - Total for blue t-shirts: \(220 + 170 = 390\)

   - **Red t-shirts:**
     - Men: \(10 \times 21 = 210\)
     - Women: \(10 \times 16 = 160\)
     - Total for red t-shirts: \(210 + 160 = 370\)

   - **Green t-shirts:**
     - Men: \(10 \times 19 = 190\)
     - Women: \(10 \times 14 = 140\)
     - Total for green t-shirts: \(190 + 140 = 330\)

   - **Gray t-shirts:**
     - Men: \(10 \times 17 = 170\)
     - Women: \(10 \times 12 = 120\)
     - Total for gray t-shirts: \(170 + 120 = 290\)

   - **Yellow t-shirts:**
     - Men: \(10 \times 16 = 160\)
     - Women: \(10 \times 11 = 110\)
     - Total for yellow t-shirts: \(160 + 110 = 270\)

   - **Purple t-shirts:**
     - Men: \(10 \times 23 = 230\)
     - Women: \(10 \times 18 = 180\)
     - Total for purple t-shirts: \(230 + 180 = 410\)

6. **Sum up the total costs for all t-shirt colors:**

What is the total number of legs in his entire collection?,344.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of creature Monroe has and then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Spiders:**
   - Each spider has 8 legs.
   - Monroe has 8 spiders.
   - Total legs from spiders = \( 8 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs/spider} = 64 \text{ legs} \).

2. **Ants:**
   - Each ant has 6 legs.
   - Monroe has 12 ants.
   - Total legs from ants = \( 12 \text{ ants} \times 6 \text{ legs/ant} = 72 \text{ legs} \).

3. **Beetles:**
   - Each beetle has 6 legs.
   - Monroe has 5 beetles.
   - Total legs from beetles = \( 5 \text{ beetles} \times 6 \text{ legs/beetle} = 30 \text{ legs} \).

4. **Scorpions:**
   - Each scorpion has 8 legs.
   - Monroe has 3 scorpions.
   - Total legs from scorpions = \( 3 \text{ scorpions} \times 8 \text{ legs/scorpion} = 24 \text{ legs} \).

5. **Crickets:**
   - Each cricket has 6 legs.
   - Monroe has 10 crickets.
   - Total legs from crickets = \( 10 \text{ crickets} \times 6 \text{ legs/cricket} = 60 \text{ legs} \).

6. **Crabs:**
   - Each crab has 8 legs.
   - Monroe has 2 crabs.
   - Total legs from crabs = \( 2 \text{ crabs} \times 8 \text{ legs/crab} = 16 \text{ legs} \).

7. **Ladybugs:**
   - Each ladybug has 6 legs.
   - Monroe has 7 ladybugs.
   - Total legs from ladybugs = \( 7 \text{ ladybugs} \times 6 \text{ legs/ladybug} = 42 \text{ legs} \).

8. **Tarantulas:**
   - Each tarantula has 8 legs.
   - Monroe has 4 tarantulas.
   - Total legs from tarantulas = \( 4 \text{ tarantulas} \times 8 \text{ legs/tarantula} = 32 \text{ legs} \).

### Summing Up All Legs:
Now, we add up all the legs from each type of creature:
\[
64 \text{ (spiders)} + 72 \text{ (ants)} + 30 \text{ (beetles)} + 24 \text{ (scorpions)} + 60 \text{ (crickets)} + 16 \text{ (crabs)} + 42 \text{ (ladybugs)} + 32 \text{ (tarantulas)}
