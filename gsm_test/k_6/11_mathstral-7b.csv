John has 5 times as many sheep as Rachel. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle, Alice, Bob, David, Zoe, John and Rachel have together if Rachel has 20 sheep?",327720.0," Let's start by finding out how many sheep Rachel has. According to the problem, Rachel has 20 sheep.

Now, let's work our way up the chain of sheep ownership:

1. John has 5 times as many sheep as Rachel, so John has 5 * 20 = 100 sheep.
2. Zoe has 4 times as many sheep as John, so Zoe has 4 * 100 = 400 sheep.
3. David has 2 times as many sheep as Zoe, so David has 2 * 400 = 800 sheep.
4. Bob has 3 times as many sheep as David, so Bob has 3 * 800 = 2400 sheep.
5. Alice has 5 times as many sheep as Bob, so Alice has 5 * 2400 = 12000 sheep.
6. Seattle has 2 times as many sheep as Alice, so Seattle has 2 * 12000 = 24000 sheep.
7. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 24000 = 96000 sheep.
8. Toulouse has 2 times as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 96000 = 192000 sheep.

Now, let's add up the number of sheep each person has:

Toulouse: 192000
Charleston: 96000
Seattle: 24000
Alice: 12000
Bob: 2400
David: 800
Zoe: 400
John: 100

1. First 3 customers buy 1 DVD each: 3 customers * 1 DVD/customer = 3 DVDs

2. Next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each: 2 customers * 2 DVDs/customer = 4 DVDs

3. Next 4 customers buy 3 DVDs each: 4 customers * 3 DVDs/customer = 12 DVDs

4. Next 2 customers buy 8 DVDs each: 2 customers * 8 DVDs/customer = 16 DVDs

5. Next 8 customers buy 9 DVDs each: 8 customers * 9 DVDs/customer = 72 DVDs

6. Next 3 customers buy 2 DVDs each: 3 customers * 2 DVDs/customer = 6 DVDs

7. Next 7 customers buy 1 DVD each: 7 customers * 1 DVD/customer = 7 DVDs

8. Next 5 customers buy 9 DVDs each: 5 customers * 9 DVDs/customer = 45 DVDs

9. Last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs: 3 customers * 0 DVDs/customer = 0 DVDs

Now, we add up all the DVDs sold:

3 DVDs + 4 DVDs + 12 DVDs + 16 DVDs + 72 DVDs + 6 DVDs + 7 DVDs + 45 DVDs + 0 DVDs = 165 DVDs

So, Billy sold a total of 165 DVDs on Tuesday.

How much money did he make from selling all the water?,504.0," First, we need to calculate the total amount of water collected each day by multiplying the inches of rain by the number of gallons collected per inch.

Monday: 4 inches * 15.0 gallons/inch = 60.0 gallons
Tuesday: 3 inches * 15.0 gallons/inch = 45.0 gallons
Wednesday: 2 inches * 15.0 gallons/inch = 30.0 gallons
Thursday: 1 inch * 15.0 gallons/inch = 15.0 gallons
Friday: 5 inches * 15.0 gallons/inch = 75.0 gallons
Saturday: 3 inches * 15.0 gallons/inch = 45.0 gallons
Sunday: 4 inches * 15.0 gallons/inch = 60.0 gallons
Next Monday: 6 inches * 15.0 gallons/inch = 90.0 gallons

1. Insulin pills: 2 per day
2. Blood pressure pills: 3 per day
3. Anticonvulsants: Twice as many as blood pressure pills, so 2 * 3 = 6 per day
4. Vitamin C: As many as insulin pills, so 2 per day
5. Cholesterol: Twice as many as blood pressure pills, so 2 * 3 = 6 per day

- Goldfish: 4 times as many as pretzels = 4 * 64 = 256
- Suckers: 32
- Granola bars: 32
- Fruit snacks: 16
- Crackers: 48
- Cookies: twice as many as granola bars = 2 * 32 = 64
- Carrots: three times as many as fruit snacks = 3 * 16 = 48
- Juice packs: two-thirds as many as crackers = (2/3) * 48 = 32

Now, let's add up all the snacks to find the total number of items:

Total items = Pretzels + Goldfish + Suckers + Granola bars + Fruit snacks + Crackers + Cookies + Carrots + Juice packs
Total items = 64 + 256 + 32 + 32 + 16 + 48 + 64 + 48 + 32
Total items = 600

Now, we divide the total number of items by the number of kids to find out how many items each baggie will have:

Items per baggie = Total items / Number of kids
Items per baggie = 600 / 16
Items per baggie = 37.5

Ed found:
7 limpet shells + 2 oyster shells + 4 conch shells = 7 + 2 + 4 = 13 shells

Jacob found 2 more shells than Ed, so:
13 shells (Ed's total) + 2 shells = 15 shells

Maya found 12 fewer than Jacob, so:
15 shells (Jacob's total) - 12 shells = 3 shells

Liam found 2 more than Maya, so:

For the necklace stand:
12 (total capacity) - 5 (currently held) = 7 necklaces needed
7 necklaces * $4 per necklace = $28

For the ring display:
30 (total capacity) - 18 (currently held) = 12 rings needed
12 rings * $10 per ring = $120

For the bracelet display:
15 (total capacity) - 8 (currently held) = 7 bracelets needed
7 bracelets * $5 per bracelet = $35

For the watch display:

If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?",767.0," Let's solve this step by step:

1. Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles.
2. Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles.
3. Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary, so Anie collected 60 + 20 = 80 red marbles.
4. Tom collected three times as many red marbles as Mary, so Tom collected 3 * 60 = 180 red marbles.
5. Sara collected 10 fewer red marbles than Anie, so Sara collected 80 - 10 = 70 red marbles.
6. Leo collected three times as many red marbles as Jenny, so Leo collected 3 * 30 = 90 red marbles.
7. Maya collected five times as many red marbles as Tom, so Maya collected 5 * 180 = 900 red marbles.
8. Ivy collected 2 fewer red marbles than Leo, so Ivy collected 90 - 2 = 88 red marbles.
9. Zane collected three times as many red marbles as Jenny, so Zane collected 3 * 30 = 90 red marbles.

Now, let's calculate the blue marbles:

1. Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, so Anie collected 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles.
2. Tom collected 5 fewer blue marbles than Jenny, so Tom collected 25 - 5 = 20 blue marbles.
3. Sara collected five times as many blue marbles as Mary. Since Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, Mary collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles. Therefore, Sara collected 5 * 25 = 125 blue marbles.
4. Leo collected three times as many blue marbles as Jenny, so Leo collected 3 * 25 = 75 blue marbles.
5. Maya collected 3 fewer blue marbles than Sara, so Maya collected 125 - 3 = 122 blue marbles.
6. Ivy collected three times as many blue marbles as Mary, so Ivy collected 3 * 25 = 75 blue marbles.
7. Zane collected five times as many blue marbles as Anie, so Zane collected 5 * 50 = 250 blue marbles.

How many 10 oz servings of punch does Carrie have?",33.0," First, let's calculate the total volume of the punch by adding up all the ingredients:

- 6 cans of Mountain Dew at 12 oz each: 6 * 12 = 72 oz
- 28 oz of ice
- 40 oz bottle of fruit juice
- 5 cans of ginger ale at 8 oz each: 5 * 8 = 40 oz
- 2 bottles of orange soda at 15 oz each: 2 * 15 = 30 oz
- 20 oz bottle of cranberry juice
- 3 scoops of sherbet at 10 oz each: 3 * 10 = 30 oz
- 2 cups of pineapple chunks at 10 oz per cup: 2 * 10 = 20 oz
- 50 oz bottle of sparkling water

Now, let's add all these volumes together to get the total volume of the punch:

72 oz (Mountain Dew) + 28 oz (ice) + 40 oz (fruit juice) + 40 oz (ginger ale) + 30 oz (orange soda) + 20 oz (cranberry juice) + 30 oz (sherbet) + 20 oz (pineapple chunks) + 50 oz (sparkling water) = 320 oz

Ben brings half as many treats as Jane and three-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats. If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",594.0," Let's start by calculating the number of treats and pieces of bread each person brings based on the information provided.

Let's denote the number of treats Jane brings as T_Jane. Since Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats, the number of pieces of bread Jane brings is 0.75 * T_Jane.

Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane, so the number of treats Wanda brings is T_Wanda = 0.5 * T_Jane. Since Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, the number of pieces of bread Wanda brings is 3 * T_Wanda = 3 * (0.5 * T_Jane) = 1.5 * T_Jane. We are given that Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, so 1.5 * T_Jane = 90. Therefore, T_Jane = 90 / 1.5 = 60 treats.

Now we can calculate the number of treats and pieces of bread for each person:

- Jane: T_Jane = 60 treats, B_Jane = 0.75 * 60 = 45 pieces of bread
- Wanda: T_Wanda = 0.5 * 60 = 30 treats, B_Wanda = 90 pieces of bread
- Carlos: T_Carlos = (1/3) * 60 = 20 treats, B_Carlos = 2 * 20 = 40 pieces of bread
- Mia: T_Mia = T_Wanda - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 treats, B_Mia = (1/2) * 20 = 10 pieces of bread
- Omar: T_Omar = (3/2) * 30 = 45 treats, B_Omar = (4/5) * 45 = 36 pieces of bread
- Priya: T_Priya = 2 * 20 = 40 treats, B_Priya = (1/4) * 40 = 10 pieces of bread
- Elena: T_Elena = T_Mia + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 treats, B_Elena = 3 * 25 = 75 pieces of bread
- Ben: T_Ben = (1/2) * 60 = 30 treats, B_Ben = (3/5) * 30 = 18 pieces of bread

Now we can calculate the total number of pieces of bread and treats:

Total treats = T_Jane + T_Wanda + T_Carlos + T_Mia + T_Omar + T_Priya + T_Elena + T_Ben
Total treats = 60 + 30 + 20 + 20 + 45 + 40 + 25 + 30
Total treats = 270

Total pieces of bread = B_Jane + B_Wanda + B_Carlos + B_Mia + B_Omar + B_Priya + B_Elena + B_Ben
Total pieces of bread = 45 + 90 + 40 + 10 + 36 + 10 + 75 + 18

Nia visited 4 fewer than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jane did. Luis visited 5 more than half as many rehabilitation centers as Nia did. Tasha visited 2 fewer than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Omar did. If Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers, how many rehabilitation centers did they all visit in total, assuming they are all different?",107.0," Let's solve this step by step:

1. Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers.
2. Jude visited half as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa did, so Jude visited 6 / 2 = 3 rehabilitation centers.
3. Han visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude did, so Han visited (2 * 3) - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4 rehabilitation centers.
4. Jane visited 6 more than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Han did, so Jane visited (2 * 4) + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14 rehabilitation centers.
5. Omar visited 3 more rehabilitation centers than Jude did, so Omar visited 3 + 3 = 6 rehabilitation centers.
6. Priya visited 1 less than three times as many rehabilitation centers as Han did, so Priya visited (3 * 4) - 1 = 12 - 1 = 11 rehabilitation centers.
7. Chen visited twice as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa did, so Chen visited 2 * 6 = 12 rehabilitation centers.
8. Nia visited 4 fewer than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jane did, so Nia visited (2 * 14) - 4 = 28 - 4 = 24 rehabilitation centers.
9. Luis visited 5 more than half as many rehabilitation centers as Nia did, so Luis visited (1/2 * 24) + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17 rehabilitation centers.
10. Tasha visited 2 fewer than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Omar did, so Tasha visited (2 * 6) - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10 rehabilitation centers.

Now, let's add up all the rehabilitation centers visited by each person:

Lisa: 6
Jude: 3
Han: 4
Jane: 14
Omar: 6
Priya: 11
Chen: 12
Nia: 24
Luis: 17
Tasha: 10

1. Bathing the dog: 20 minutes
2. Blow-drying the dog: 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes
3. Brushing the dog: 8 minutes
4. Trimming the dog's nails: 8 minutes / 2 = 4 minutes
5. Driving to the trailhead: 9 miles / 30 miles per hour = 0.3 hours = 18 minutes
6. Filling the water bowl and giving a treat: 6 minutes
7. Walking the 3-mile trail: 3 miles / 6 miles per hour = 0.5 hours = 30 minutes
8. Jogging 2 miles: 2 miles / 8 miles per hour = 0.25 hours = 15 minutes
9. Cleaning up muddy paw prints: 10 minutes

Now, let's add up all the time spent:

For orange crayons: 6 boxes * 8 crayons/box = 48 crayons
For blue crayons: 7 boxes * 5 crayons/box = 35 crayons
For red crayons: 1 box * 11 crayons/box = 11 crayons
For green crayons: 4 boxes * 6 crayons/box = 24 crayons
For purple crayons: 2 boxes * 9 crayons/box = 18 crayons
For yellow crayons: 3 boxes * 10 crayons/box = 30 crayons
For brown crayons: 5 boxes * 4 crayons/box = 20 crayons
For black crayons: 1 box * 12 crayons/box = 12 crayons

How many tarantulas does he need to see to meet his goal?",111.0," First, let's calculate the total number of legs Borgnine has seen so far.

Chimps have 4 legs each, so 12 chimps have 12 * 4 = 48 legs.
Lions have 4 legs each, so 8 lions have 8 * 4 = 32 legs.
Lizards have 4 legs each, so 5 lizards have 5 * 4 = 20 legs.
Penguins have 2 legs each, so 8 penguins have 8 * 2 = 16 legs.
Elephants have 4 legs each, so 6 elephants have 6 * 4 = 24 legs.
Parrots have 2 legs each, so 12 parrots have 12 * 2 = 24 legs.
Turtles have 4 legs each, so 4 turtles have 4 * 4 = 16 legs.
Scorpions have 6 legs each, so 3 scorpions have 3 * 6 = 18 legs.
Frogs have 4 legs each, so 8 frogs have 8 * 4 = 32 legs.

Now, let's add up all the legs Borgnine has seen:

48 (chimps) + 32 (lions) + 20 (lizards) + 16 (penguins) + 24 (elephants) + 24 (parrots) + 16 (turtles) + 18 (scorpions) + 32 (frogs) = 230 legs.

Borgnine wants to see a total of 1100 legs. So, the number of legs he still needs to see is:

1100 - 230 = 870 legs.

Tarantulas have 8 legs each. To find out how many tarantulas Borgnine needs to see to meet his goal, we divide the remaining number of legs by the number of legs a tarantula has:

870 / 8 = 108.75.

Since Borgnine can't see a fraction of a tarantula, he needs to see 109 tarantulas to meet his goal.

A paperclip chain is 4 centimeters shorter than the stylus. what is the total length of the rubber, the pen, the pencil, and all the other stationery items mentioned altogether?",104.0," Let's calculate the length of each item step by step:

1. Pencil: Given as 12 centimeters.

2. Pen: The pen is shorter than the pencil by 2 centimeters.
   Pen = Pencil - 2 cm
   Pen = 12 cm - 2 cm
   Pen = 10 cm

3. Rubber: The pen is longer than the rubber by 3 centimeters.
   Rubber = Pen - 3 cm
   Rubber = 10 cm - 3 cm
   Rubber = 7 cm

4. Marker: The marker is 1 centimeter longer than the pencil.
   Marker = Pencil + 1 cm
   Marker = 12 cm + 1 cm
   Marker = 13 cm

5. Crayon: The crayon is 2 centimeters shorter than the rubber.
   Crayon = Rubber - 2 cm
   Crayon = 7 cm - 2 cm
   Crayon = 5 cm

6. Ruler: The ruler is twice as long as the pencil.
   Ruler = 2 * Pencil
   Ruler = 2 * 12 cm
   Ruler = 24 cm

7. Paintbrush: The paintbrush is 3 centimeters longer than the pen.
   Paintbrush = Pen + 3 cm
   Paintbrush = 10 cm + 3 cm
   Paintbrush = 13 cm

8. Stylus: The stylus is half as long as the ruler.
   Stylus = Ruler / 2
   Stylus = 24 cm / 2
   Stylus = 12 cm

9. Paperclip chain: The paperclip chain is 4 centimeters shorter than the stylus.
   Paperclip chain = Stylus - 4 cm
   Paperclip chain = 12 cm - 4 cm
   Paperclip chain = 8 cm

Now, let's add up the lengths of all the items:

Total length = Rubber + Pen + Pencil + Marker + Crayon + Ruler + Paintbrush + Stylus + Paperclip chain

According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 96:

x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 96

Solving for x:

3x + 3 = 96
3x = 93
x = 31

So, the youngest of the three oldest brothers is 31 years old.

Now, let's find the ages of the younger brothers:

Liam is 1 year younger than the youngest of the three oldest brothers, so Liam is 31 - 1 = 30 years old.
Noah is 1 year younger than Liam, so Noah is 30 - 1 = 29 years old.
Owen is 1 year younger than Noah, so Owen is 29 - 1 = 28 years old.
Ethan is 1 year younger than Owen, so Ethan is 28 - 1 = 27 years old.
Mason is 1 year younger than Ethan, so Mason is 27 - 1 = 26 years old.

They spend $200 every quarter on club events for the family. John agrees to pay half the total cost for the whole family. How much does John pay for the first year?,35590.0," First, let's calculate the total cost for the whole family for the first year.

1. Joining fee for 4 people: 4 * $4000 = $16,000
2. Monthly cost for 4 people: 12 * 4 * $1000 = $48,000
3. Annual maintenance fee for 4 people: 4 * $600 = $2,400
4. Monthly gym access for 4 people: 12 * 4 * $50 = $2,400
5. Guest passes for 2 people each month: 12 * 2 * $30 = $720
6. One-time processing fee for the family: $500
7. Annual locker rental for 3 members: 3 * $120 = $360
8. Quarterly club events for the family: 4 * $200 = $800

Now, let's add all these costs together to get the total cost for the first year:

Total cost = $16,000 + $48,000 + $2,400 + $2,400 + $720 + $500 + $360 + $800 = $72,780

John agrees to pay half of this total cost, so:

John's payment = $72,780 / 2 = $36,390

Therefore, John pays $36,390 for the first year.","36,390",36390.0,False,

He buys 5 peacocks that cost 50% less each than a pony. He buys 3 kangaroos that cost 20% more each than a zebra. He buys 8 rabbits for $75 each. How much did he spend?",14430.0," Let's calculate the cost for each type of animal Tim buys for his zoo.

1. Goats:
He buys 3 goats for $400 each.
Total cost for goats = 3 * $400 = $1200

2. Llamas:
He gets twice as many llamas as goats, so he buys 3 * 2 = 6 llamas.
Each llama costs 50% more than a goat, so each llama costs $400 + (50% of $400) = $400 + $200 = $600.
Total cost for llamas = 6 * $600 = $3600

3. Alpacas:
He buys 4 alpacas that cost 25% less each than a llama.
25% of $600 (cost of a llama) = $150.
So, each alpaca costs $600 - $150 = $450.
Total cost for alpacas = 4 * $450 = $1800

4. Zebras:
He buys 2 zebras that cost twice as much as a goat each.
Twice the cost of a goat = 2 * $400 = $800.
Total cost for zebras = 2 * $800 = $1600

5. Ponies:
He buys as many ponies as goats, so he buys 3 ponies.
Each pony costs $100 more than a goat, so each pony costs $400 + $100 = $500.
Total cost for ponies = 3 * $500 = $1500

6. Peacocks:
He buys 5 peacocks that cost 50% less each than a pony.
50% of $500 (cost of a pony) = $250.
So, each peacock costs $500 - $250 = $250.
Total cost for peacocks = 5 * $250 = $1250

7. Kangaroos:
He buys 3 kangaroos that cost 20% more each than a zebra.
20% of $800 (cost of a zebra) = $160.
So, each kangaroo costs $800 + $160 = $960.
Total cost for kangaroos = 3 * $960 = $2880

8. Rabbits:
He buys 8 rabbits for $75 each.
Total cost for rabbits = 8 * $75 = $600

Now, let's add up the total cost for all the animals:
Total cost = $1200 (goats) + $3600 (llamas) + $1800 (alpacas) + $1600 (zebras) + $1500 (ponies) + $1250 (peacocks) + $2880 (kangaroos) + $600 (rabbits)

Morgan has as many stuffed animals as Riley and Casey have combined. Peyton has 2 fewer stuffed animals than McKenna. How many stuffed animals do all the people mentioned have in all?,551.0," Let's calculate the number of stuffed animals each person has:

1. McKenna has 34 stuffed animals.

2. Kenley has twice as many as McKenna, so Kenley has 2 * 34 = 68 stuffed animals.

3. Tenly has 5 more than Kenley, so Tenly has 68 + 5 = 73 stuffed animals.

4. Riley has 10 fewer stuffed animals than Tenly, so Riley has 73 - 10 = 63 stuffed animals.

5. Avery has half as many stuffed animals as Kenley, so Avery has 68 / 2 = 34 stuffed animals.

6. Jordan has 3 times as many stuffed animals as McKenna, so Jordan has 3 * 34 = 102 stuffed animals.

7. Casey has 7 more stuffed animals than Avery, so Casey has 34 + 7 = 41 stuffed animals.

8. Morgan has as many stuffed animals as Riley and Casey have combined, so Morgan has 63 + 41 = 104 stuffed animals.

He also has 10 crickets. He also has 2 crabs. He also has 7 ladybugs. He also has 4 tarantulas. What is the total number of legs in his entire collection?,344.0," To find the total number of legs in Monroe's collection, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of creature and then sum them up.

- Spiders have 8 legs each.
- Ants have 6 legs each.
- Beetles have 6 legs each.
- Scorpions have 8 legs each.
- Crickets have 6 legs each.
- Crabs have 8 legs each.
- Ladybugs have 6 legs each.
- Tarantulas have 8 legs each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of creature:

- Spiders: 8 spiders * 8 legs = 64 legs
- Ants: 12 ants * 6 legs = 72 legs
- Beetles: 5 beetles * 6 legs = 30 legs
- Scorpions: 3 scorpions * 8 legs = 24 legs
- Crickets: 10 crickets * 6 legs = 60 legs
- Crabs: 2 crabs * 8 legs = 16 legs
- Ladybugs: 7 ladybugs * 6 legs = 42 legs
- Tarantulas: 4 tarantulas * 8 legs = 32 legs

Now, let's add up all the legs:

64 (spiders) + 72 (ants) + 30 (beetles) + 24 (scorpions) + 60 (crickets) + 16 (crabs) + 42 (ladybugs) + 32 (tarantulas) = 330 legs

If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",135.0," Let's calculate the number of each color of gumballs based on the information provided:

1. Red gumballs: 16 (given)
2. Blue gumballs: Half as many as red gumballs, so 16 / 2 = 8
3. Green gumballs: 4 times as many as blue gumballs, so 8 * 4 = 32
4. Yellow gumballs: As many as blue gumballs, so 8
5. Purple gumballs: 3 fewer than red gumballs, so 16 - 3 = 13
6. Orange gumballs: Twice as many as blue gumballs, so 8 * 2 = 16
7. Pink gumballs: One-fourth as many as green gumballs, so 32 / 4 = 8
8. White gumballs: As many as the total number of yellow and blue gumballs combined, so 8 (yellow) + 8 (blue) = 16
