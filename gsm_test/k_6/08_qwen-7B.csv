John has 5 times as many sheep as Rachel. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle, Alice, Bob, David, Zoe, John and Rachel have together if Rachel has 20 sheep?",327720.0,"Let's start by defining the number of sheep each person has based on the relationships given and the fact that Rachel has 20 sheep.

1. **Rachel**: \( R = 20 \)
2. **John**: \( J = 5R = 5 \times 20 = 100 \)
3. **Zoe**: \( Z = \frac{J}{4} = \frac{100}{4} = 25 \)
4. **David**: \( D = 2Z = 2 \times 25 = 50 \)
5. **Bob**: \( B = \frac{D}{3} = \frac{50}{3} \approx 16.67 \) (Since the number of sheep must be an integer, we need to check the consistency of the problem statement or assume it allows fractional sheep for this calculation.)
6. **Alice**: \( A = 5B = 5 \times \frac{50}{3} = \frac{250}{3} \approx 83.33 \)
7. **Seattle**: \( S = \frac{A}{2} = \frac{\frac{250}{3}}{2} = \frac{250}{6} \approx 41.67 \)
8. **Charleston**: \( C = 4S = 4 \times \frac{250}{6} = \frac{1000}{6} \approx 166.67 \)
9. **Toulouse**: \( T = 2C = 2 \times \frac{1000}{6} = \frac{2000}{6} \approx 333.33 \)

Now, let's sum up all the sheep:

\[
T + C + S + A + B + D + Z + J + R = \frac{2000}{6} + \frac{1000}{6} + \frac{250}{6} + \frac{250}{3} + \frac{50}{3} + 50 + 25 + 100 + 20
\]

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 3 is 6.

\[
\frac{2000}{6} + \frac{1000}{6} + \frac{250}{6} + \frac{500}{6} + \frac{100}{6} + \frac{300}{6} + \frac{150}{6} + \frac{600}{6} + \frac{120}{6}
\]

Combine the numerators:

\[
\frac{2000 + 1000 + 250 + 500 + 100 + 300 + 150 + 600 + 120}{6} = \frac{4920}{6} = 820

On Thursday it rained 1 inches. On Friday it rained 5 inches. On Saturday it rained 3 inches. On Sunday it rained 4 inches. On Next Monday it rained 6 inches. He can sell water for $1.2 per gallon. How much money did he make from selling all the water?,504.0,"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of rain collected over the week and the next Monday.
2. Convert the total inches of rain into gallons.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the water.

**Step 1: Calculate the total inches of rain collected.**

- Monday: 4 inches
- Tuesday: 3 inches
- Wednesday: 2 inches
- Thursday: 1 inch
- Friday: 5 inches
- Saturday: 3 inches
- Sunday: 4 inches
- Next Monday: 6 inches

Total inches of rain = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 28 inches

**Step 2: Convert the total inches of rain into gallons.**

Given that 1 inch of rain equals 15.0 gallons, we can calculate the total gallons as follows:

Total gallons = Total inches of rain × Gallons per inch
Total gallons = 28 inches × 15.0 gallons/inch
Total gallons = 420 gallons

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the water.**

Given that water is sold at $1.2 per gallon, we can calculate the total revenue as follows:

Total revenue = Total gallons × Price per gallon
Total revenue = 420 gallons × $1.2/gallon
Total revenue = $504.00

   - Each kitchen wall takes up 500 square feet, and there are 6 kitchens.
   - Total area for kitchens = \(500 \times 6 = 3000\) square feet

4. **Dining Room Walls:**
   - Each dining room wall takes up 240 square feet, and there are 5 dining rooms.
   - Total area for dining rooms = \(240 \times 5 = 1200\) square feet

5. **Bathroom Walls:**
   - Each bathroom wall takes up 150 square feet, and there are 8 bathrooms.
   - Total area for bathrooms = \(150 \times 8 = 1200\) square feet

6. **Garage Walls:**
   - Each garage wall takes up 480 square feet, and there are 5 garages.
   - Total area for garages = \(480 \times 5 = 2400\) square feet

7. **Hallway Walls:**
   - Each hallway wall takes up 900 square feet, and there are 8 hallways.
   - Total area for hallways = \(900 \times 8 = 7200\) square feet

8. **Sunroom Walls:**
   - Each sunroom wall takes up 300 square feet, and there are 6 sunrooms.
   - Total area for sunrooms = \(300 \times 6 = 1800\) square feet

Now, summing up all these areas:

\[
600 + 1200 + 3000 + 1200 + 1200 + 2400 + 7200 + 1800 = 18600 \text{ square feet}
\]

Next, we calculate the number of gallons of paint needed. Since one gallon covers 600 square feet:

\[
\frac{18600}{600} = 31 \text{ gallons}
\]

Therefore, Henrietta needs 31 gallons of paint to cover all the walls in her house.

1. **Carlo Rosi** is given to be 40 years old.
   - \( \text{Carlo Rosi} = 40 \)

2. **Franzia** is three times as old as the Carlo Rosi.
   - \( \text{Franzia} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \)

3. **Twin Valley** is one-fourth the age of the Carlo Rosi.

1. **Antelopes**: \( A = 80 \)
2. **Rabbits**: \( R = A + 34 = 80 + 34 = 114 \)

7. **Sunday**: As many kilometers as the sum of the kilometers from Monday and Saturday
   - Sum of Monday and Saturday = 40 + 32.5 = 72.5 kilometers

8. **Next Monday**: 60 kilometers

9. **Next Tuesday**: 20% more kilometers than Next Monday
   - 20% of 60 kilometers = \( \frac{20}{100} \times 60 = 12 \) kilometers
   - Therefore, 20% more kilometers = 60 + 12 = 72 kilometers

10. **Next Wednesday**: As many kilometers as the sum of the kilometers from Friday and Tuesday
    - Sum of Friday and Tuesday = 30 + 50 = 80 kilometers

Now, let's add up all the kilometers:

\[
40 + 50 + 25 + 65 + 30 + 32.5 + 72.5 + 60 + 72 + 80
\]

First, add the known values:

\[
40 + 50 + 25 + 65 + 30 + 32.5 + 72.5 = 315

Then add the remaining values:

\[
315 + 60 + 72 + 80 = 527

1. **Wanda's contributions:**
   - Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread.
   - Let \( T_W \) be the number of treats Wanda brings.
   - According to the problem, Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats: \( 90 = 3T_W \).
   - Solving for \( T_W \): \( T_W = \frac{90}{3} = 30 \).

2. **Jane's contributions:**
   - Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats.
   - Let \( T_J \) be the number of treats Jane brings.
   - Jane brings \( 0.75T_J \) pieces of bread.
   - Since Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane: \( 30 = \frac{1}{2}T_J \).
   - Solving for \( T_J \): \( T_J = 30 \times 2 = 60 \).
   - Therefore, Jane brings \( 0.75 \times 60 = 45 \) pieces of bread.

3. **Carlos's contributions:**
   - Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane: \( T_C = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \).

   - Mia brings half as many pieces of bread as treats: \( B_M = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \).

5. **Omar's contributions:**
   - Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda: \( T_O = 1.5 \times 30 = 45 \).
   - Omar brings four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats: \( B_O = \frac{4}{5} \times 45 = 36 \).

6. **Priya's contributions:**
   - Priya brings twice as many treats as Carlos: \( T_P = 2 \times 20 = 40 \).
   - Priya brings one-fourth as many pieces of bread as treats: \( B_P = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \).

7. **Elena's contributions:**
   - Elena brings 5 more treats than Mia: \( T_E = 20 + 5 = 25 \).
   - Elena brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats: \( B_E = 3 \times 25 = 75 \).

First, let's list the animals and their leg counts:

- Chimps: 12 chimps × 2 legs each = 24 legs
- Lions: 8 lions × 4 legs each = 32 legs
- Lizards: 5 lizards × 4 legs each = 20 legs
- Penguins: 8 penguins × 2 legs each = 16 legs
- Elephants: 6 elephants × 4 legs each = 24 legs
- Parrots: 12 parrots × 2 legs each = 24 legs
- Turtles: 4 turtles × 4 legs each = 16 legs
- Scorpions: 3 scorpions × 8 legs each = 24 legs
- Frogs: 8 frogs × 4 legs each = 32 legs

Now, let's calculate the total length of all the items:

\[
\text{Total length} = P + Pe + M + R + PB + S + PC + Rb + Cr
\]

We already have the values for most items:
\[
P = 12 \text{ cm}, \quad Pe = 10 \text{ cm}, \quad M = 13 \text{ cm}, \quad R = 24 \text{ cm}, \quad PB = 13 \text{ cm}, \quad S = 12 \text{ cm}, \quad PC = 8 \text{ cm}, \quad Rb = 7 \text{ cm}
\]

The crayon is 2 cm shorter than the rubber:
\[
Cr = Rb - 2 = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ cm}
\]

Adding all these together:
\[
\text{Total length} = 12 + 10 + 13 + 24 + 13 + 12 + 8 + 7 + 5 = 92 \text{ cm}

How old is the youngest brother?,25.0,"Let's denote the ages of the three oldest brothers as \(x\), \(x+1\), and \(x+2\). These represent consecutive integers.

Given that the sum of their ages is 96, we can write the equation:
\[ x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 96 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 3x + 3 = 96 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 3x = 93 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 31 \]

So, the ages of the three oldest brothers are 31, 32, and 33.

Next, we determine the age of Liam, who is 1 year younger than the youngest of the three oldest brothers:
\[ 31 - 1 = 30 \]

Noah is 1 year younger than Liam:
\[ 30 - 1 = 29 \]

Owen is 1 year younger than Noah:
\[ 29 - 1 = 28 \]

Ethan is 1 year younger than Owen:
\[ 28 - 1 = 27 \]

Mason is 1 year younger than Ethan:
\[ 27 - 1 = 26 \]

Lucas is 1 year younger than Mason:
\[ 26 - 1 = 25 \]

Thus, the youngest brother, Lucas, is 25 years old.

If his farm produced 400 kg of mangoes and he sold the fruits at $50 per kg, calculate the total amount of money he got in that season.",195000.0,"Let's start by defining the variables based on the information given:

- Let \( M \) be the total produce of mangoes.
- Given: \( M = 400 \) kg.

Now, let's find the produce for each type of fruit:

1. **Apples (A):**
   - Total produce of apples was twice the total produce of mangoes.
   - Therefore, \( A = 2M = 2 \times 400 = 800 \) kg.

2. **Oranges (O):**
   - Total produce of oranges was 200 kg more than that of mangoes.
   - Therefore, \( O = M + 200 = 400 + 200 = 600 \) kg.

3. **Bananas (B):**
   - He produced 100 kg fewer bananas than apples.
   - Therefore, \( B = A - 100 = 800 - 100 = 700 \) kg.

4. **Peaches (P):**
   - The total produce of peaches was half the total produce of oranges.
   - Therefore, \( P = \frac{O}{2} = \frac{600}{2} = 300 \) kg.

5. **Guavas (G):**
   - He harvested one-fourth as many guavas as mangoes.
   - Therefore, \( G = \frac{M}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) kg.

6. **Lemons (L):**
   - The total produce of lemons was 50 kg more than the total produce of peaches.
   - Therefore, \( L = P + 50 = 300 + 50 = 350 \) kg.

7. **Plums (Pl):**
   - He produced twice as many plums as guavas.
   - Therefore, \( Pl = 2G = 2 \times 100 = 200 \) kg.

8. **Cherries (Ch):**
   - He harvested 150 kg fewer cherries than oranges.
   - Therefore, \( Ch = O - 150 = 600 - 150 = 450 \) kg.

Next, we sum up all the produces to get the total produce of all fruits:

\[
\text{Total produce} = A + M + O + B + P + G + L + Pl + Ch

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total produce} = 800 + 400 + 600 + 700 + 300 + 100 + 350 + 200 + 450

Calculating the sum:

\[
\text{Total produce} = 3900 \text{ kg}

How much did he spend?",14430.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cost of goats:**
   - Tim buys 3 goats at $400 each.
   - Total cost for goats = \(3 \times 400 = 1200\).

2. **Cost of llamas:**
   - He gets twice as many llamas as goats, so 6 llamas.
   - Each llama costs 50% more than a goat.
   - Cost per llama = \(400 + 0.5 \times 400 = 400 + 200 = 600\).
   - Total cost for llamas = \(6 \times 600 = 3600\).

3. **Cost of alpacas:**
   - He buys 4 alpacas that cost 25% less than a llama.
   - Cost per alpaca = \(600 - 0.25 \times 600 = 600 - 150 = 450\).
   - Total cost for alpacas = \(4 \times 450 = 1800\).

4. **Cost of zebras:**
   - He buys 2 zebras that cost twice as much as a goat.
   - Cost per zebra = \(2 \times 400 = 800\).
   - Total cost for zebras = \(2 \times 800 = 1600\).

5. **Cost of ponies:**
   - He buys as many ponies as goats, so 3 ponies.
   - Each pony costs $100 more than a goat.
   - Cost per pony = \(400 + 100 = 500\).
   - Total cost for ponies = \(3 \times 500 = 1500\).

6. **Cost of peacocks:**
   - He buys 5 peacocks that cost 50% less than a pony.
   - Cost per peacock = \(500 - 0.5 \times 500 = 500 - 250 = 250\).
   - Total cost for peacocks = \(5 \times 250 = 1250\).

7. **Cost of kangaroos:**
   - He buys 3 kangaroos that cost 20% more than a zebra.
   - Cost per kangaroo = \(800 + 0.2 \times 800 = 800 + 160 = 960\).
   - Total cost for kangaroos = \(3 \times 960 = 2880\).

8. **Cost of rabbits:**
   - He buys 8 rabbits for $75 each.

How much did he spend total on buying t-shirts?",2720.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the t-shirts Juan bought for his employees. We will break it down into steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of each type of women's t-shirt
- White women's t-shirt: \( \$20 - \$5 = \$15 \)
- Black women's t-shirt: \( \$18 - \$5 = \$13 \)
- Blue women's t-shirt: \( \$22 - \$5 = \$17 \)
- Red women's t-shirt: \( \$21 - \$5 = \$16 \)
- Green women's t-shirt: \( \$19 - \$5 = \$14 \)
- Gray women's t-shirt: \( \$17 - \$5 = \$12 \)
- Yellow women's t-shirt: \( \$16 - \$5 = \$11 \)
- Purple women's t-shirt: \( \$23 - \$5 = \$18 \)

### Step 2: Calculate the cost for each sector
Each sector has 10 men and 10 women. Therefore, the cost for one sector is calculated as follows:

- **White sector**: \( 10 \times \$20 + 10 \times \$15 = \$200 + \$150 = \$350 \)
- **Black sector**: \( 10 \times \$18 + 10 \times \$13 = \$180 + \$130 = \$310 \)
- **Blue sector**: \( 10 \times \$22 + 10 \times \$17 = \$220 + \$170 = \$390 \)
- **Red sector**: \( 10 \times \$21 + 10 \times \$16 = \$210 + \$160 = \$370 \)
- **Green sector**: \( 10 \times \$19 + 10 \times \$14 = \$190 + \$140 = \$330 \)
- **Gray sector**: \( 10 \times \$17 + 10 \times \$12 = \$170 + \$120 = \$290 \)
- **Yellow sector**: \( 10 \times \$16 + 10 \times \$11 = \$160 + \$110 = \$270 \)
- **Purple sector**: \( 10 \times \$23 + 10 \times \$18 = \$230 + \$180 = \$410 \)

8,qwen-7B,Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct,6,48,47,"Robin wants to buy jelly bracelets for her friends. She decides to buy one bracelet for each letter of the first name of her friends. Her friends are Jessica, Tori, Lily, Patrice, Ava, Monique, Ben, Charlotte, Ian, and Zoe. If each jelly bracelet costs $2, what is the total she will spend in dollars?",100.0,"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of letters in each friend's first name.**
2. **Calculate the total number of jelly bracelets Robin needs to buy.**
3. **Multiply the total number of bracelets by the cost per bracelet to find the total amount spent.**

Let's start with step 1:

- Jessica: 7 letters
- Tori: 4 letters
- Lily: 4 letters
- Patrice: 7 letters
- Ava: 3 letters
- Monique: 7 letters
- Ben: 3 letters
- Charlotte: 9 letters
- Ian: 3 letters
- Zoe: 3 letters

Now, let's move to step 2 and sum up the total number of letters:

\[ 7 + 4 + 4 + 7 + 3 + 7 + 3 + 9 + 3 + 3 = 50 \]

So, Robin needs to buy 50 jelly bracelets.

Finally, for step 3, we multiply the total number of bracelets by the cost per bracelet:

\[ 50 \times 2 = 100 \]

Therefore, the total amount Robin will spend is:

He also has 10 crickets. He also has 2 crabs. He also has 7 ladybugs. He also has 4 tarantulas. What is the total number of legs in his entire collection?,344.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs contributed by each type of insect and then sum these values.

1. **Spiders**: Each spider has 8 legs.
   - Total legs from spiders = \(8 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs/spider} = 64 \text{ legs}\).

2. **Ants**: Each ant has 6 legs.
   - Total legs from ants = \(12 \text{ ants} \times 6 \text{ legs/ant} = 72 \text{ legs}\).

3. **Beetles**: Each beetle has 6 legs.
   - Total legs from beetles = \(5 \text{ beetles} \times 6 \text{ legs/beetle} = 30 \text{ legs}\).

4. **Scorpions**: Each scorpion has 8 legs.
   - Total legs from scorpions = \(3 \text{ scorpions} \times 8 \text{ legs/scorpion} = 24 \text{ legs}\).

5. **Crickets**: Each cricket has 6 legs.
   - Total legs from crickets = \(10 \text{ crickets} \times 6 \text{ legs/cricket} = 60 \text{ legs}\).

6. **Crabs**: Each crab has 10 legs.
   - Total legs from crabs = \(2 \text{ crabs} \times 10 \text{ legs/crab} = 20 \text{ legs}\).

7. **Ladybugs**: Each ladybug has 6 legs.
   - Total legs from ladybugs = \(7 \text{ ladybugs} \times 6 \text{ legs/ladybug} = 42 \text{ legs}\).

8. **Tarantulas**: Each tarantula has 8 legs.
   - Total legs from tarantulas = \(4 \text{ tarantulas} \times 8 \text{ legs/tarantula} = 32 \text{ legs}\).

Now, we sum all the legs:

\[
64 + 72 + 30 + 24 + 60 + 20 + 42 + 32 = 344

The machine has as many white gumballs as the total number of yellow and blue gumballs combined. The machine has 5 more brown gumballs than purple gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",135.0,"Let's start by defining the variables based on the given information:

- Let \( R \) be the number of red gumballs.
- Let \( B \) be the number of blue gumballs.
- Let \( G \) be the number of green gumballs.
- Let \( Y \) be the number of yellow gumballs.
- Let \( P \) be the number of purple gumballs.
- Let \( O \) be the number of orange gumballs.
- Let \( K \) be the number of pink gumballs.
- Let \( W \) be the number of white gumballs.
- Let \( N \) be the number of brown gumballs.

Given that \( R = 16 \):

1. **Blue gumballs:**
   - The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs.
   \[
   B = \frac{R}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
   \]

2. **Green gumballs:**
   - For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs.
   \[
   G = 4B = 4 \times 8 = 32
   \]

3. **Yellow gumballs:**
   - The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs.
   \[
   Y = B = 8
   \]

4. **Purple gumballs:**
   - The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs.
   \[
   P = R - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13
   \]

5. **Orange gumballs:**
   - The machine has twice as many orange gumballs as blue gumballs.
   \[
   O = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16
   \]

6. **Pink gumballs:**
   - The machine has one-fourth as many pink gumballs as green gumballs.
   \[
   K = \frac{G}{4} = \frac{32}{4} = 8
   \]

7. **White gumballs:**
   - The machine has as many white gumballs as the total number of yellow and blue gumballs combined.
   \[
   W = Y + B = 8 + 8 = 16
   \]

8. **Brown gumballs:**
   - The machine has 5 more brown gumballs than purple gumballs.
   \[
   N = P + 5 = 13 + 5 = 18
   \]

Now, we sum up all the gumballs to find the total number of gumballs in the machine:
\[
R + B + G + Y + P + O + K + W + N = 16 + 8 + 32 + 8 + 13 + 16 + 8 + 16 + 18
\]

Calculating the sum:
\[
16 + 8 = 24
\]
\[
24 + 32 = 56
\]
\[
56 + 8 = 64
\]
\[
64 + 13 = 77
\]
\[
77 + 16 = 93
\]
\[
93 + 8 = 101
