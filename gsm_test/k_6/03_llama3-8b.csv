She also spends 1 minutes warm-up, 2 minutes costume changes, 1 minutes interviews, 3 minutes meet-and-greet, 2 minutes vocal coaching, and 7 minutes travel time for each minute singing. If her final stage performance is 6 minutes long, what is the total combined amount of time, in minutes, that she spends practicing, throwing tantrums, singing, warm-up, costume changes, interviews, meet-and-greet, vocal coaching and travel time in the final stage performance?",150.0,"6 minutes

Explanation:
Let x be the number of minutes that Carlotta sings on stage during the final opera performance.
Then, the number of minutes that she spends practicing is 3x.
The number of minutes that she spends throwing tantrums is 5x.
The number of minutes that she spends singing is x.
The number of minutes that she spends warm-up is 1.
The number of minutes that she spends costume changes is 2.
The number of minutes that she spends interviews is 1.
The number of minutes that she spends meet-and-greet is 3.
The number of minutes that she spends vocal coaching is 2.
The number of minutes that she spends travel time is 7.
The total combined amount of time, in minutes, that she spends practicing, throwing tantrums, singing, warm-up, costume changes, interviews, meet-and-greet, vocal coaching and travel time in the final stage performance is:
3x + 5x + x + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 7 = 24x + 16
If her final stage performance is 6 minutes long, then:
24x + 16 = 6
24x = -10
x = -10/24
x = -5/12
The total combined amount of time, in minutes, that she spends practicing, throwing tantrums, singing, warm-up, costume changes, interviews, meet-and-greet, vocal coaching and travel time in the final stage performance is:
3x + 5x + x + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 7 = 24x + 16
24x + 16 = 24(-5/12) + 16
= -10 + 16

There were also 2 less than three times as many teal candies as brown candies. If Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, how many candies remained?",1568.0,"0

Explanation:
Let the number of yellow candies be y.
Then, the number of red candies = 3y - 20
The number of blue candies = 2y
The number of green candies = 2(3y - 20)
The number of purple candies = 5y - 10
The number of orange candies = y/5
The number of brown candies = 4y
The number of pink candies = 3/4(4y)
The number of teal candies = 3(4y) - 2
The number of candies remaining = y + 3y - 20 + 2y + 2(3y - 20) + 5y - 10 + y/5 + 4y + 3/4(4y) + 3(4y) - 2

3,llama3-8b,meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B,6,15,14,"Josie and her family went on a safari and had an exciting time watching different animals grazing and playing together. She decided to count each animal she saw and calculated their total number. She counted 80 antelopes, 34 more rabbits than antelopes, 42 fewer hyenas than the total number of antelopes and rabbits combined, 50 more wild dogs than hyenas, and the number of leopards was half the number of rabbits. There were also twice as many zebras as leopards. There were also 3 fewer giraffes than zebras. There were also half as many buffaloes as antelopes and rabbits combined. There were also two-thirds as many monkeys as rabbits and leopards combined. There were also 5 more elephants than the total number of wild dogs and hyenas combined. There were also 2 more hippos than one-fifth as many antelopes. What is the total number of animals that Josie counted?",1418.0,"1.5k

Explanation:
Let the number of antelopes be x.
The number of rabbits is x + 34.
The number of hyenas is x + x + 34 – 42 = 2x + 32.
The number of wild dogs is 2x + 32 + 50 = 2x + 82.
The number of leopards is (x + x + 34)/2 = x + 17.
The number of zebras is 2(x + 17).
The number of giraffes is 2(x + 17) – 3 = 2x + 29.
The number of buffaloes is (x + x + 34)/2 = x + 17.
The number of monkeys is (x + x + 34 + x + 17)/3 = 2x + 51.

If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",594.0,"1, 100

Explanation:

Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats to feed the live pets at the zoo. Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane and three times as many pieces of bread as treats. Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane and twice as many pieces of bread as treats. Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda and half as many pieces of bread as treats. Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda and four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats. Priya brings twice as many treats as Carlos and one-fourth as many pieces of bread as treats. Elena brings 5 more treats than Mia and three times as many pieces of bread as treats. Ben brings half as many treats as Jane and three-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats. If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?

Let's start by finding the number of treats that Wanda brings. We know that Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane, so we can write the following equation:

Wanda's treats = 0.5 x Jane's treats

We also know that Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, so we can write the following equation:

Wanda's bread = 3 x Wanda's treats

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get:

Wanda's bread = 3 x 0.5 x Jane's treats

= 1.5 x Jane's treats

We know that Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, so we can substitute this into the equation above to get:

90 = 1.5 x Jane's treats

Jane's treats = 60

We can now find the number of treats that each person brings by using the equations we have already written. For example, we know that Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane, so we can write the following equation:

Carlos's treats = 0.33 x Jane's treats

= 0.33 x 60

= 20

We can now find the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo by adding up the number of treats and pieces of bread that each person brought. We get:

Jane's treats + Wanda's treats + Carlos's treats + Mia's treats + Omar's treats + Priya's treats + Elena's treats + Ben's treats

= 60 + 60 + 20 + 50 + 90 + 40 + 55 + 30

3,llama3-8b,meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B,6,25,24,"When Jane visited Iran, she visited 6 more than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Han. Han visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude did. Jude visited half as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa did. Omar visited 3 more rehabilitation centers than Jude did. Priya visited 1 less than three times as many rehabilitation centers as Han did. Chen visited twice as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa did. Nia visited 4 fewer than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jane did. Luis visited 5 more than half as many rehabilitation centers as Nia did. Tasha visited 2 fewer than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Omar did. If Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers, how many rehabilitation centers did they all visit in total, assuming they are all different?",107.0,"0

Explanation:

Let's start by assigning variables to the number of rehabilitation centers each person visited. We'll use the following variables:

J = Jane
H = Han
J = Jude
L = Lisa
O = Omar
P = Priya
C = Chen
N = Nia
L = Luis
T = Tasha

We can now write the following equations:

J = 6 + 2H
H = 2J - 2
J = 0.5L
O = J + 3
P = 3H - 1
C = 2L
N = 2J - 4
L = 0.5N + 5
T = 2O - 2

We can now solve for the number of rehabilitation centers each person visited. We'll start by solving for H:

H = 2J - 2
H = 2(6 + 2H) - 2
H = 12 + 4H - 2
H = 10 + 4H
4H - 10 = 0
4H = 10
H = 2.5

We can now solve for J:

J = 6 + 2H
J = 6 + 2(2.5)
J = 6 + 5
J = 11

We can now solve for L:

L = 0.5J
L = 0.5(11)
L = 5.5

We can now solve for O:

O = J + 3
O = 11 + 3
O = 14

We can now solve for P:

P = 3H - 1
P = 3(2.5) - 1
P = 7.5 - 1
P = 6.5

We can now solve for C:

C = 2L
C = 2(5.5)
C = 11

We can now solve for N:

N = 2J - 4
N = 2(11) - 4
N = 22 - 4
N = 18

We can now solve for L:

L = 0.5N + 5
L = 0.5(18) + 5
L = 9 + 5
L = 14

We can now solve for T:

T = 2O - 2
T = 2(14) - 2
T = 28 - 2
T = 26

We can now solve for the total number of rehabilitation centers they all visited:

Total = J + H + J + L + O + P + C + N + L + T
Total = 11 + 2.5 + 11 + 5.5 + 14 + 6.5 + 11 + 18 + 14 + 26
Total = 99

Therefore, the total number of rehabilitation centers they all visited is 99.",99,99.0,False,

3,llama3-8b,meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B,6,35,34,"Mr. Sergio is a fruit grower producing apples, mangoes and oranges. In a particular season, the total produce of apples was twice the total produce of mangoes, and the total produce of oranges was 200 kg more than that of mangoes. He also produced 100 kg fewer bananas than apples. The total produce of peaches was half the total produce of oranges. He harvested one-fourth as many guavas as mangoes. The total produce of lemons was 50 kg more than the total produce of peaches. He produced twice as many plums as guavas. He harvested 150 kg fewer cherries than oranges. If his farm produced 400 kg of mangoes and he sold the fruits at $50 per kg, calculate the total amount of money he got in that season.",195000.0,"20000

Explanation:
Let the total produce of mangoes be x kg.
Then, the total produce of apples = 2x kg
The total produce of oranges = x + 200 kg
The total produce of bananas = 2x – 100 kg
The total produce of peaches = x + 200/2 = x + 100 kg
The total produce of guavas = x/4 kg
The total produce of lemons = x + 100 kg
The total produce of plums = 2x/4 = x/2 kg
The total produce of cherries = x – 150 kg
Total produce of fruits = x + 2x + x + 200 + 2x – 100 + x + 100 + x/4 + x + 100 + x/2 + x – 150
= 6x + 500
6x + 500 = 400
6x = 400 – 500
6x = – 100
x = – 100/6
x = – 16.67
The total produce of mangoes = – 16.67 kg
The total produce of apples = 2(– 16.67) = – 33.34 kg
The total produce of oranges = – 16.67 + 200 = 183.33 kg
The total produce of bananas = – 16.67 – 100 = – 16.67 kg
The total produce of peaches = – 16.67 + 100 = 83.33 kg
The total produce of guavas = – 16.67/4 = – 4.17 kg
The total produce of lemons = – 16.67 + 100 = 83.33 kg
The total produce of plums = 2(– 16.67)/4 = – 8.33 kg
The total produce of cherries = – 16.67 – 150 = – 166.67 kg
The total amount of money he got = 400 × 50 = 20000
Therefore, the total amount of money he got in that season is $20000.",20000,20000.0,False,
