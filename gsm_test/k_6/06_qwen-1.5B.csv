1. **Rachel's Sheep**: We know that Rachel has 20 sheep.
   \[
   \text{Sheep for Rachel} = 20
   \]

2. **John's Sheep**: John has 5 times as many sheep as Rachel.
   \[
   \text{Sheep for John} = 5 \times 20 = 100
   \]

3. **David's Sheep**: David has 2 times as many sheep as John.
   \[
   \text{Sheep for David} = 2 \times 100 = 200

   Since we don't know the exact number of sheep for Seattle yet, let's denote it as \( S \).

8. **Seattle's Sheep**: Seattle has 2 times as many sheep as Alice.
   \[
   \text{Sheep for Seattle} = 2 \times 3000 = 6000

9. **Toulouse's Sheep**: Toulouse has 2 times as many sheep as Charleston.
   \[
   \text{Sheep for Toulouse} = 2 \times (4 \times 6000) = 48000

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rain that fell during the week.**

The rainfall amounts for each day are as follows:
- Monday: 4 inches
- Tuesday: 3 inches
- Wednesday: 2 inches
- Thursday: 1 inch
- Friday: 5 inches
- Saturday: 3 inches
- Sunday: 4 inches

First, let's break down the information given:

- **Time spent singing:** 6 minutes

Now, let's determine how much time Carlotta spends on other activities based on the ratio provided:

- **Practicing:** For every 1 minute of singing, she practices for 3 minutes.
- **Throwing temper tantrums:** For every 1 minute of singing, she throws tantrums for 5 minutes.

   - Daily: 3 pills

3. **Anticonvulsants:**
   - Daily: Twice as many as blood pressure pills = \(2 \times 3 = 6\) pills

- Teal candies: \( T = \frac{Pk}{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{4Br}{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{16Br}{3} \)

First, we need to find the value of \( B \) using the relationship between blue and yellow candies:
\[ B = \frac{Y}{2} \]

Next, substitute \( Y = 3R - 20 \):
\[ B = \frac{3R - 20}{2} \]

Now, let's express everything in terms of \( R \). We know that \( R = 40 \), so:
\[ B = \frac{3(40) - 20}{2} = \frac{120 - 20}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]

Now we can calculate the other quantities:
\[ Y = 3R - 20 = 3(40) - 20 = 120 - 20 = 100 \]
\[ B = \frac{Y}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]
\[ G = \frac{R}{2} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]
\[ P = 5Y - 10 = 5(100) - 10 = 500 - 10 = 490 \]
\[ O = \frac{Y}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \]
\[ Br = 5B = 5(50) = 250 \]
\[ Pk = 4Br = 4(250) = 1000 \]
\[ T = \frac{16Br}{3} = \frac{16(250)}{3} = \frac{4000}{3} \approx 1333.33 \] (but since it must be an integer, we'll use 1333 for simplicity)

1. **Living Room:**
   - Area = 600 square feet

2. **Bedrooms:**
   - Each bedroom takes up 400 square feet.
   - There are 3 bedrooms.
   - Total for bedrooms = \( 400 \times 3 = 1200 \) square feet

3. **Kitchen:**
   - Each kitchen wall takes up 500 square feet.
   - There are 6 kitchens.
   - Total for kitchen = \( 500 \times 6 = 3000 \) square feet

4. **Dining Room:**
   - Each dining room wall takes up 240 square feet.
   - There are 5 dining rooms.
   - Total for dining room = \( 240 \times 5 = 1200 \) square feet

5. **Bathroom:**
   - Each bathroom wall takes up 150 square feet.
   - There are 8 bathrooms.
   - Total for bathroom = \( 150 \times 8 = 1200 \) square feet

6. **Garage:**
   - Each garage wall takes up 480 square feet.
   - There are 5 garages.
   - Total for garage = \( 480 \times 5 = 2400 \) square feet

7. **Hallway:**
   - Each hallway wall takes up 900 square feet.
   - There are 8 hallways.
   - Total for hallway = \( 900 \times 8 = 7200 \) square feet

8. **Sunroom:**
   - Each sunroom wall takes up 300 square feet.
   - There are 6 sunrooms.
   - Total for sunroom = \( 300 \times 6 = 1800 \) square feet

1. **Carlo Rosi's Age:**
   - Given: \( \text{Carlo Rosi} = 40 \) years

2. **Twin Valley's Age:**
   - Carlo Rosi is four times as old as the Twin Valley.
   - Let \( T \) be the age of the Twin Valley.
   - Therefore, \( 4T = 40 \).

If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?",767.0,"Let's start by determining the number of red and blue marbles each friend collected based on the given information.

First, we know that Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles.

**Jenny:**
- Red marbles: \( R_J = 30 \)
- Blue marbles: \( B_J = 25 \)

Next, let's find out how many red and blue marbles Anie collected. According to the problem, Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. Let's denote the number of red marbles Mary collected as \( R_M \) and the number of blue marbles Mary collected as \( B_M \).

Since Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary, we have:
\[ R_A = R_M + 20 \]

And since Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, we have:
\[ B_A = 2B_J = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

Now, we need to express \( R_M \) and \( B_M \) in terms of \( R_A \) and \( B_A \). Since Anie collected 50 blue marbles, we can use this information to find \( B_M \):
\[ B_A = B_M + 50 \]
\[ 50 = B_M + 50 \]
\[ B_M = 0 \]

This seems incorrect because it implies no blue marbles were collected by Mary. Let's re-evaluate the relationship between Mary and Anie's collections. Given that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, and knowing Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, Anie must have collected:
\[ B_A = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

So, we have:
\[ B_A = 50 \]

Now, using the relationship between Anie's and Mary's red marbles:
\[ R_A = R_M + 20 \]
\[ 50 = R_M + 20 \]
\[ R_M = 30 \]

Thus, Mary collected 30 red marbles and 0 blue marbles (since \( B_M = 0 \)).

**Mary:**
- Red marbles: \( R_M = 30 \)
- Blue marbles: \( B_M = 0 \)

Next, let's determine how many red and blue marbles Tom collected. The problem states that Tom collected three times as many red marbles as Mary:
\[ R_T = 3R_M = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Tom also collected 5 fewer blue marbles than Jenny:
\[ B_T = B_J - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \]

So, Tom collected 90 red marbles and 20 blue marbles.

**Tom:**
- Red marbles: \( R_T = 90 \)
- Blue marbles: \( B_T = 20 \)

Now, let's find out how many red and blue marbles Anie collected again. We already calculated that Anie collected 50 blue marbles. Now, let's calculate her red marbles:
\[ R_A = R_M + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 \]

So, Anie collected 50 red marbles and 50 blue marbles.

**Anie:**
- Red marbles: \( R_A = 50 \)
- Blue marbles: \( B_A = 50 \)

Next, let's determine how many red and blue marbles Sara collected. The problem states that Sara collected 10 fewer red marbles than Anie:
\[ R_S = R_A - 10 = 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Sara also collected five times as many blue marbles as Mary:
\[ B_S = 5B_M = 5 \times 0 = 0 \]

So, Sara collected 40 red marbles and 0 blue marbles.

**Sara:**
- Red marbles: \( R_S = 40 \)
- Blue marbles: \( B_S = 0 \)

Finally, let's determine how many red and blue marbles Leo collected. The problem states that Leo collected three times as many red marbles as Jenny:
\[ R_L = 3R_J = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Leo also collected three times as many blue marbles as Jenny:
\[ B_L = 3B_J = 3 \times 25 = 75 \]

So, Leo collected 90 red marbles and 75 blue marbles.

**Leo:**
- Red marbles: \( R_L = 90 \)
- Blue marbles: \( B_L = 75 \)

Lastly, let's determine how many red and blue marbles Maya collected. The problem states that Maya collected five times as many red marbles as Tom:
\[ R_Ma = 5R_T = 5 \times 90 = 450 \]

Maya also collected 3 fewer blue marbles than Sara:
\[ B_Ma = B_S - 3 = 0 - 3 = -3 \]

Since negative blue marbles don't make sense, we should re-evaluate the problem constraints or calculations. However, assuming the problem is correctly stated, we proceed with the given values:

**Maya:**
- Red marbles: \( R_Ma = 450 \)
- Blue marbles: \( B_Ma = -3 \) (incorrect, so assume 0 for practical purposes)

Summarizing all the blue marbles collected:
\[ B_J = 25 \]
\[ B_M = 0 \]
\[ B_A = 50 \]
\[ B_S = 0 \]
\[ B_L = 75 \]
\[ B_Ma = 0 \]

Total blue marbles:
\[ B_{total} = 25 + 0 + 50 + 0 + 75 + 0 = 150 \]

Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is:

Let's start with Wanda:

- Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread.
- Since Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane, let \( T_J \) be the number of treats Jane brings. Then, \( \frac{1}{2}T_J = 90 \), so \( T_J = 180 \).
- Wanda also brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, which matches our information (3 * 90 = 270).

Next, let's find out how much each other person brought:

- **Carlos**: 
  - Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane, so he brings \( \frac{1}{3} \times 180 = 60 \) treats.
  - Carlos brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats, so he brings \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) pieces of bread.

- **Mia**:
  - Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda, so she brings \( 90 - 10 = 80 \) treats.
  - Mia brings half as many pieces of bread as treats, so she brings \( \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \) pieces of bread.

- **Omar**:
  - Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda, so he brings \( 1.5 \times 90 = 135 \) treats.
  - Omar brings four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats, so he brings \( \frac{4}{5} \times 90 = 72 \) pieces of bread.

- **Priya**:
  - Priya brings twice as many treats as Carlos, so she brings \( 2 \times 60 = 120 \) treats.
  - Priya brings one-fourth as many pieces of bread as treats, so she brings \( \frac{1}{4} \times 120 = 30 \) pieces of bread.

- **Elena**:
  - Elena brings 5 more treats than Mia, so she brings \( 80 + 5 = 85 \) treats.
  - Elena brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, so she brings \( 3 \times 40 = 120 \) pieces of bread.

- **Ben**:
  - Ben brings half as many treats as Jane, so he brings \( \frac{1}{2} \times 180 = 90 \) treats.
  - Ben brings three-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats, so he brings \( \frac{3}{5} \times 90 = 54 \) pieces of bread.

Now, let's sum up all the treats and pieces of bread:

- Total treats: \( 180 + 60 + 80 + 120 + 135 + 120 + 90 = 805 \)

### Step 1: Determine the produce of each type of fruit

Given:
- Total produce of mangoes = 400 kg
- Produce of apples = Twice the produce of mangoes
- Produce of oranges = 200 kg more than the produce of mangoes
- Produce of bananas = 100 kg fewer than the produce of apples
- Produce of peaches = Half the produce of oranges
- Produce of guavas = One-fourth the produce of mangoes
- Produce of lemons = 50 kg more than the produce of peaches
- Produce of plums = Twice the produce of guavas
- Produce of cherries = 150 kg fewer than the produce of oranges

Let's start with the given information:

1. **Mangoes**: \( M = 400 \) kg
2. **Apples**: \( A = 2M = 2 \times 400 = 800 \) kg
3. **Oranges**: \( O = M + 200 = 400 + 200 = 600 \) kg
4. **Bananas**: \( B = A - 100 = 800 - 100 = 700 \) kg
5. **Peaches**: \( P = \frac{O}{2} = \frac{600}{2} = 300 \) kg
6. **Guavas**: \( G = \frac{M}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) kg

8. **Plums**: \( Plums = 2G = 2 \times 100 = 200 \) kg
9. **Cherries**: \( C = O - 150 = 600 - 150 = 450 \) kg

### Step 2: Calculate the total produce of all fruits

Now, let's sum up the produces of all the fruits:

\[
Total = M + A + O + B + P + G + L + Plums + C
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
Total = 400 + 800 + 600 + 700 + 300 + 100 + 350 + 200 + 450

Calculate the total:

\[
Total = 400 + 800 + 600 + 700 + 100 + 350 + 200 + 450 = 3800 \text{ kg}

There is also an annual maintenance fee of $600 per person. Each person also pays $50 per month for gym access. The family buys 2 guest passes each month at $30 each. There is a one-time processing fee of $500 for the whole family. They rent lockers for 3 of the members at $120 per locker for the year. They spend $200 every quarter on club events for the family. John agrees to pay half the total cost for the whole family. How much does John pay for the first year?,35590.0,"To determine how much John pays for the first year, we need to calculate the total cost for all family members and then find out what John's share would be.

### Step 1: Calculate the Monthly Cost Per Person

The monthly costs include:
- Gym access: $50 per person
- Guest pass: $30 per person (2 guests)
- Maintenance fee: $1000 per person

Total monthly cost per person = $50 + ($30 * 2) + $1000 = $50 + $60 + $1000 = $1110

### Step 2: Calculate the Annual Cost Per Person

Annual cost per person includes:
- Gym access: $50 per person
- Guest pass: $30 per person (2 guests)
- Maintenance fee: $1000 per person
- One-time processing fee: $500 per person
- Lockers: $120 per locker for 3 lockers = $120 * 3 = $360
- Club event fees: $200 per quarter = $200 * 4 = $800 (since there are four quarters in a year)

Total annual cost per person = $50 + ($30 * 2) + $1000 + $500 + $360 + $800 = $50 + $60 + $1000 + $500 + $360 + $800 = $2270

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Annual Cost For All Family Members

There are 4 people in the family, so:

Total annual cost for all family members = $2270 * 4 = $9080

### Step 4: Calculate John's Share

John agrees to pay half the total cost:

John's share = $9080 / 2 = $4540

Therefore, the amount John pays for the first year is $\boxed{4540}$.",4540,4540.0,False,

Savanna National park has 5 more hippos than its crocodiles. How many animals in total does Savanna National park have?",840.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of each type of animal in both Safari National Park (SNP) and Savanna National Park (SNP), then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Safari National Park (SNP):**
   - Lions: \(100\)
   - Snakes: \(\frac{100}{2} = 50\)
   - Giraffes: \(50 - 10 = 40\)
   - Zebras: \(2 \times 40 = 80\)
   - Elephants: \(50 - 5 = 45\)
   - Monkeys: \(3 \times 40 = 120\)
   - Crocodiles: \(\frac{100}{5} = 20\)
   - Flamingos: \(3 \times 50 = 150\)
   - Hippos: \(45 + 5 = 50\)

2. **Savanna National Park (SNP):**
   - Lions: \(2 \times 100 = 200\)
   - Snakes: \(3 \times 50 = 150\)
   - Giraffes: \(40 + 20 = 60\)
   - Zebras: \(\frac{200}{2} = 100\)
   - Elephants: \(45 + 20 = 65\)
   - Monkeys: \(120 - 10 = 110\)
   - Crocodiles: \(20 \times 2 = 40\)
   - Flamingos: \(150 / 3 = 50\)
   - Hippos: \(50 + 5 = 55\)

Now, let's add up all the animals from both parks:

- Total animals in SNP: 
  \[
  100 (\text{lions}) + 50 (\text{snakes}) + 40 (\text{giraffes}) + 80 (\text{zebras}) + 45 (\text{elephants}) + 120 (\text{monkeys}) + 20 (\text{crocodiles}) + 150 (\text{flamingos}) + 50 (\text{hippos})
  \]
  \[
  = 100 + 50 + 40 + 80 + 45 + 120 + 20 + 150 + 50 = 705
  \]

- Total animals in SNP:
  \[
  200 (\text{lions}) + 150 (\text{snakes}) + 60 (\text{giraffes}) + 100 (\text{zebras}) + 65 (\text{elephants}) + 110 (\text{monkeys}) + 40 (\text{crocodiles}) + 50 (\text{flamingos}) + 55 (\text{hippos})
  \]
  \[
  = 200 + 150 + 60 + 100 + 65 + 110 + 40 + 50 + 55 = 900
  \]

Since there is no overlap between the two parks, the total number of animals in Savanna National Park is simply the sum of the animals calculated above for SNP.

He buys 5 peacocks that cost 50% less each than a pony. He buys 3 kangaroos that cost 20% more each than a zebra. He buys 8 rabbits for $75 each. How much did he spend?",14430.0,"To determine how much Tim spent on all the animals, we need to calculate the cost of each type of animal separately and then sum these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost of the goats:
- Tim bought 3 goats at $400 each.
\[
\text{Cost of goats} = 3 \times 400 = 1200
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the llamas:
- Tim bought twice as many llamas as goats, so he bought \(2 \times 3 = 6\) llamas.
- Each llama costs 50% more than a goat, so each llama costs \(400 + (0.5 \times 400) = 400 + 200 = 600\) dollars.
\[
\text{Cost of llamas} = 6 \times 600 = 3600
\]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the alpacas:
- Each alpaca costs 25% less than a llama, so each alpaca costs \(600 - (0.25 \times 600) = 600 - 150 = 450\) dollars.
\[
\text{Cost of alpacas} = 4 \times 450 = 1800
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the zebras:
- Each zebra costs twice as much as a goat, so each zebra costs \(400 \times 2 = 800\) dollars.
\[
\text{Cost of zebras} = 2 \times 800 = 1600
\]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the ponies:
- Each pony costs $100 more than a goat, so each pony costs \(400 + 100 = 500\) dollars.
\[
\text{Cost of ponies} = 8 \times 500 = 4000
\]

Now, let's calculate the cost of the peacocks:
- Each peacock costs 50% less than a pony, so each peacock costs \(500 - (0.5 \times 500) = 500 - 250 = 250\) dollars.
\[
\text{Cost of peacocks} = 5 \times 250 = 1250
\]

Finally, let's calculate the cost of the kangaroos:
- Each kangaroo costs 20% more than a zebra, so each kangaroo costs \(800 \times 1.20 = 960\) dollars.
\[
\text{Cost of kangaroos} = 3 \times 960 = 2880

Adding up all the costs gives us the total amount spent:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 1200 + 3600 + 1800 + 1600 + 4000 + 1250 + 2880 = 16830

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Optimal Wind Conditions (Two Sails):**
   - Speed: 50 knots
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Distance: \( 50 \text{ knots} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ nautical miles} \)

2. **Optimal Wind Conditions (One Sail):**
   - Speed: 25 knots
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Distance: \( 25 \text{ knots} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 100 \text{ nautical miles} \)

3. **Three Sails:**
   - Speed: 60 knots
   - Time: 1 hour

6. **Extra Cargo:**
   - Speed: 40 knots
   - Time: 1 hour
   - Distance: \( 40 \text{ knots} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 40 \text{ nautical miles} \)

7. **Current:**
   - Speed: 30 knots
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance: \( 30 \text{ knots} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ nautical miles} \)

8. **Drift:**
   - Speed: 5 knots
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Distance: \( 5 \text{ knots} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ nautical miles} \)

Now, let's convert these distances from nautical miles to land miles using the conversion factor \( 1 \text{ nautical mile} = 1.15 \text{ land miles} \):

9. **Total Distance:**

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Distance with Two Sails} & : 200 \text{ nautical miles} \\
\text{Distance with One Sail} & : 100 \text{ nautical miles} \\
\text{Distance with Three Sails} & : 60 \text{ nautical miles} \\
\text{Distance with Four Sails} & : 140 \text{ nautical miles} \\
\text{Distance with Reefed Sail} & : 60 \text{ nautical miles} \\
\text{Distance with Extra Cargo} & : 40 \text{ nautical miles} \\
\text{Distance with Current} & : 60 \text{ nautical miles} \\
\text{Distance Drifting} & : 20 \text{ nautical miles} \\
\end{align*}
\]

Convert each distance to land miles:

\[
\begin{align*}
200 \text{ nautical miles} & : 200 \times 1.15 = 230 \text{ land miles} \\
100 \text{ nautical miles} & : 100 \times 1.15 = 115 \text{ land miles} \\
60 \text{ nautical miles} & : 60 \times 1.15 = 69 \text{ land miles} \\
140 \text{ nautical miles} & : 140 \times 1.15 = 161 \text{ land miles} \\
60 \text{ nautical miles} & : 60 \times 1.15 = 69 \text{ land miles} \\

60 \text{ nautical miles} & : 60 \times 1.15 = 69 \text{ land miles} \\
20 \text{ nautical miles} & : 20 \times 1.15 = 23 \text{ land miles} \\

He needs to know how many pieces to cut the lasagna into to serve it. Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Another friend, Nora, is picky and will only eat one-third of what Manny eats, and Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. Another friend, Ben, will eat the same amount of lasagna as Kai. Another friend, Tina, loves lasagna and will eat 3 pieces. Another friend, Omar, will eat half as much as Kai. Another friend, Zoe, will eat one more piece of lasagna than Manny. Another friend, Gus, will only taste lasagna and eat one-fourth of what Manny eats, and Kai will finish whatever Gus leaves of his piece. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",16.0,"To determine how many pieces Manny should cut his lasagna into, we need to calculate the total number of pieces each person will consume and then sum these amounts.

1. **Manny**: Will eat 1 piece.
2. **Aaron**: Will eat 0 pieces (he won't eat lasagna).
3. **Kai**: Will eat twice as much as Manny, so he will eat \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pieces.
4. **Raphael**: Will eat half the amount Manny does, so he will eat \(1/2 = 0.5\) pieces. Since he can't eat half a piece, let's assume he eats 0 pieces (as per the problem statement).
5. **Lisa**: Will eat two pieces plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Since Raphael ate 0 pieces, Lisa will eat 2 pieces.
6. **Nora**: Will eat one-third of what Manny eats, so she will eat \(1/3 \times 1 = \frac{1}{3}\) pieces. Since she can't eat a fraction of a piece, let's assume she eats 0 pieces (as per the problem statement).
7. **Ben**: Will eat the same amount as Kai, so he will eat 2 pieces.
8. **Tina**: Will eat 3 pieces.
9. **Omar**: Will eat half as much as Kai, so he will eat \(1/2 \times 2 = 1\) piece.
10. **Zoe**: Will eat one more piece than Manny, so she will eat \(1 + 1 = 2\) pieces.
11. **Gus**: Will only taste lasagna and eat one-fourth of what Manny eats, so he will eat \(1/4 \times 1 = 0.25\) pieces. Since he can't eat a fraction of a piece, let's assume he eats 0 pieces (as per the problem statement).

Now, let's sum up all the pieces:

- Manny: 1 piece

- Raphael: 0 pieces
- Lisa: 2 pieces
- Nora: 0 pieces
- Ben: 2 pieces

He paid $23 for purple men's t-shirts. Each sector has 10 men and 10 women, so there are 160 employees in total. How much did he spend total on buying t-shirts?",2720.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each type of shirt (men's or women's) and then sum up the costs for all sectors.

First, let's determine the price of men's t-shirts:

- White men's t-shirts: $20
- Black men's t-shirts: $18
- Blue men's t-shirts: $22
- Red men's t-shirts: $21
- Green men's t-shirts: $19
- Gray men's t-shirts: $17
- Yellow men's t-shirts: $16
- Purple men's t-shirts: $23

Now, let's find the price of women's t-shirts based on the given information that they are $5 cheaper than men's t-shirts of the same color:

- White women's t-shirts: $20 - $5 = $15
- Black women's t-shirts: $18 - $5 = $13
- Blue women's t-shirts: $22 - $5 = $17
- Red women's t-shirts: $21 - $5 = $16
- Green women's t-shirts: $19 - $5 = $14
- Gray women's t-shirts: $17 - $5 = $12
- Yellow women's t-shirts: $16 - $5 = $11
- Purple women's t-shirts: $23 - $5 = $18

Next, we'll calculate the total cost for each sector:

Each sector has 10 men and 10 women, making it 20 people per sector. Since there are 8 sectors, we have a total of \(8 \times 20 = 160\) employees.

For men's t-shirts:
- Total cost for white men's t-shirts: \(20 \text{ men} \times \$20/\text{man} = \$400\)
- Total cost for black men's t-shirts: \(20 \text{ men} \times \$18/\text{man} = \$360\)
- Total cost for blue men's t-shirts: \(20 \text{ men} \times \$22/\text{man} = \$440\)
- Total cost for red men's t-shirts: \(20 \text{ men} \times \$21/\text{man} = \$420\)
- Total cost for green men's t-shirts: \(20 \text{ men} \times \$19/\text{man} = \$380\)
- Total cost for gray men's t-shirts: \(20 \text{ men} \times \$17/\text{man} = \$340\)
- Total cost for yellow men's t-shirts: \(20 \text{ men} \times \$16/\text{man} = \$320\)
- Total cost for purple men's t-shirts: \(20 \text{ men} \times \$23/\text{man} = \$460\)

Total cost for men's t-shirts: 
\[ \$400 + \$360 + \$440 + \$420 + \$380 + \$340 + \$320 + \$460 = \$3000 \]

For women's t-shirts:
- Total cost for white women's t-shirts: \(20 \text{ women} \times \$15/\text{woman} = \$300\)
- Total cost for black women's t-shirts: \(20 \text{ women} \times \$13/\text{woman} = \$260\)
- Total cost for blue women's t-shirts: \(20 \text{ women} \times \$17/\text{woman} = \$340\)
- Total cost for red women's t-shirts: \(20 \text{ women} \times \$16/\text{woman} = \$320\)
- Total cost for green women's t-shirts: \(20 \text{ women} \times \$14/\text{woman} = \$280\)
- Total cost for gray women's t-shirts: \(20 \text{ women} \times \$12/\text{woman} = \$240\)
- Total cost for yellow women's t-shirts: \(20 \text{ women} \times \$11/\text{woman} = \$220\)
- Total cost for purple women's t-shirts: \(20 \text{ women} \times \$18/\text{woman} = \$360\)

Total cost for women's t-shirts:
\[ \$300 + \$260 + \$340 + \$320 + \$280 + \$240 + \$220 + \$360 = \$2400 \]

Finally, we add the total costs for both men's and women's t-shirts to get the overall total spent:
