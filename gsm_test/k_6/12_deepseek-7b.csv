Kenneth has three times as many fish as Micah, so Kenneth has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
Matthias has 15 fewer fish than Kenneth, so Matthias has 21 - 15 = 6 fish.
Noah has 7 times as many fish as Micah, so Noah has 7 * 7 = 49 fish.
Liam has 5 fewer fish than Kenneth, so Liam has 21 - 5 = 16 fish.
Owen has 3 times as many fish as Matthias, so Owen has 3 * 6 = 18 fish.
Ethan has 10 fewer fish than Owen, so Ethan has 18 - 10 = 8 fish.
Ava has 4 times as many fish as Micah, so Ava has 4 * 7 = 28 fish.
Sophia has 2 fewer fish than Ava, so Sophia has 28 - 2 = 26 fish.
In total, they have 7 + 21 + 6 + 49 + 16 + 18 + 8 + 28 + 26 = 185 fish.

If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?",767.0," Let's denote the number of red marbles collected by each friend as follows:

- Jenny: R_J = 30
- Mary: R_M
- Anie: R_A
- Tom: R_T
- Sara: R_S
- Leo: R_L

- Mary: B_M
- Anie: B_A
- Tom: B_T
- Sara: B_S
- Leo: B_L
- Maya: B_M
- Ivy: B_I
- Zane: B_Z

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

- R_M = 2 * R_J
- B_A = 2 * B_J
- R_A = R_M + 20
- B_A = 2 * B_J
- R_T = 3 * R_M

- R_I = R_L - 2
- B_I = 3 * B_M
- R_Z = 3 * R_J
- B_Z = 5 * B_A

We are given that Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, so we can substitute these values into the equations:

- R_M = 2 * 30 = 60
- B_M = 25
- R_A = 60 + 20 = 80
- B_A = 2 * 25 = 50
- R_T = 3 * 60 = 180
- B_T = 25 - 5 = 20
- R_S = 80 - 10 = 70
- B_S = 5 * 25 = 125
- R_L = 3 * 30 = 90
- B_L = 3 * 25 = 75
- R_M = 5 * 180 = 900
- B_M = 125 - 3 = 122

- Chopping peppers: 4 peppers * 3 minutes/pepper = 12 minutes
- Chopping onions: 2 onions * 4 minutes/onion = 8 minutes
- Grating cheese: 5 omelets * 1 minute/omelet = 5 minutes
- Assembling and cooking omelets: 5 omelets * 5 minutes/omelet = 25 minutes
- Chopping tomatoes: 3 tomatoes * 4 minutes/tomato = 12 minutes
- Slicing mushrooms: 5 omelets * 2 minutes/omelet = 10 minutes
- Dicing ham: 5 omelets * 3 minutes/omelet = 15 minutes
- Rinse spinach: 5 omelets * 1 minute/omelet = 5 minutes
- Crack and whisk eggs: 5 omelets * 2 minutes/omelet = 10 minutes
- Washing cutting board and knife: 1 time * 6 minutes/time = 6 minutes

Mancino's gardens:
3 gardens * (16 feet * 5 feet) = 3 * 80 square feet = 240 square feet

Marquita's gardens:
2 gardens * (8 feet * 4 feet) = 2 * 32 square feet = 64 square feet

Luis's gardens:
4 gardens * (10 feet * 6 feet) = 4 * 60 square feet = 240 square feet

From the problem, we know that:

1. Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane, so W = J/2.
2. Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, so B_W = 90.
3. Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane, so C = J/3.
4. Carlos brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats, so B_C = 2C.
5. Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda, so M = W - 10.
6. Mia brings half as many pieces of bread as treats, so B_M = M/2.
7. Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda, so O = 1.5W.
8. Omar brings four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats, so B_O = 4/5O.
9. Priya brings twice as many treats as Carlos, so P = 2C.
10. Priya brings one-fourth as many pieces of bread as treats, so B_P = P/4.
11. Elena brings 5 more treats than Mia, so E = M + 5.
12. Elena brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, so B_E = 3E.
13. Ben brings half as many treats as Jane, so B = J/2.
14. Ben brings three-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats, so B_B = 3/5B.

We also know that:

1. Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats, so B_J = 0.75B_J.
2. Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane, so W = J/2.
3. Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, so B_W = 90.

Now, we can substitute the known values into the equations and solve for the unknowns.

From equation 1, we have W = J/2, so J = 2W = 2*90 = 180.

From equation 2, we have B_W = 90, so B_J = 0.75B_J = 0.75*90 = 67.5.

From equation 3, we have C = J/3 = 180/3 = 60.

From equation 4, we have B_C = 2C = 2*60 = 120.

From equation 5, we have M = W - 10 = 90 - 10 = 80.

From equation 6, we have B_M = M/2 = 80/2 = 40.

From equation 7, we have O = 1.5W = 1.5*90 = 135.

From equation 8, we have B_O = 4/5O = 4/5*135 = 108.

From equation 9, we have P = 2C = 2*60 = 120.

From equation 10, we have B_P = P/4 = 120/4 = 30.

From equation 11, we have E = M + 5 = 80 + 5 = 85.

From equation 12, we have B_E = 3E = 3*85 = 255.

From equation 13, we have B = J/2 = 180/2 = 90.

From equation 14, we have B_B = 3/5B = 3/5*90 = 54.

The total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo is the sum of the bread and treats brought by each person:

B_total = B_J + B_W + B_C + B_M + B_O + B_P + B_E + B_B = 67.5 + 90 + 120 + 40 + 108 + 30 + 255 + 54 = 834.5.

If each competitor was asked a different question, how many questions were asked in the competition?",184.0," Let's break down the information given:

- Drew got 20 questions correct and 6 questions wrong.
- Carla got 14 questions correct and twice as many questions wrong as Drew.
- Maya got 3 fewer questions correct than Drew and 2 more questions wrong than Drew.
- Eli got 5 more questions correct than Carla and half as many questions wrong as Carla.
- Sasha got twice as many questions correct as the number of questions Drew got wrong, and she got 4 fewer questions wrong than Carla.
- Noah got the same number of questions correct as Carla and 3 fewer questions wrong than Drew.
- Priya got 2 fewer questions correct than Eli and 1 more question wrong than Sasha.
- Jamal got 4 fewer questions correct than Maya and twice as many questions wrong as Noah.

We can start by calculating the number of questions each competitor got right and wrong:

- Carla got 14 questions correct and 2 * 6 = 12 questions wrong.
- Maya got 20 - 3 = 17 questions correct and 6 + 2 = 8 questions wrong.
- Eli got 14 + 5 = 19 questions correct and 12 / 2 = 6 questions wrong.
- Sasha got 2 * 6 = 12 questions correct and 12 - 4 = 8 questions wrong.
- Noah got 14 questions correct and 6 - 3 = 3 questions wrong.
- Priya got 19 - 2 = 17 questions correct and 8 + 1 = 9 questions wrong.
- Jamal got 17 - 4 = 13 questions correct and 3 * 2 = 6 questions wrong.

Now, we can add up the total number of questions each competitor got:

- Drew got 20 + 6 = 26 questions.
- Carla got 14 + 12 = 26 questions.
- Maya got 17 + 8 = 25 questions.
- Eli got 19 + 6 = 25 questions.
- Sasha got 12 + 8 = 20 questions.
- Noah got 14 + 3 = 17 questions.
- Priya got 17 + 9 = 26 questions.
- Jamal got 13 + 6 = 19 questions.

Finally, we can add up the total number of questions asked in the competition:

26 (Drew) + 26 (Carla) + 25 (Maya) + 25 (Eli) + 20 (Sasha) + 17 (Noah) + 26 (Priya) + 19 (Jamal) = 184 questions.

He buys 4 alpacas that cost 25% less each than a llama, so each alpaca costs $600 * 0.75 = $450.
He spends 4 * $450 = $1800 on alpacas.
He buys 2 zebras that cost twice as much as a goat each, so each zebra costs $400 * 2 = $800.
He spends 2 * $800 = $1600 on zebras.
He buys as many ponies as goats, so he buys 3 ponies.
Each pony costs $100 more than a goat, so each pony costs $400 + $100 = $500.
He spends 3 * $500 = $1500 on ponies.
He buys 5 peacocks that cost 50% less each than a pony, so each peacock costs $500 * 0.5 = $250.
He spends 5 * $250 = $1250 on peacocks.
He buys 3 kangaroos that cost 20% more each than a zebra, so each kangaroo costs $800 * 1.2 = $960.

Under optimal wind conditions, the use of two sails brings the ship to the speed of 50 knots, whereas under the same conditions, the use of one sail brings her ship to the speed of 25 knots. A knot is a nautical term for speed equal to 1 nautical mile per hour, and one nautical mile equals 1.15 land miles. If she travels in her sailboat under optimal wind conditions for 4 hours with one sail and then for another 4 hours with two sails, Under the same conditions, the use of three sails brings the ship to the speed of 60 knots, and she sails for 1 hour using three sails. Under the same conditions, the use of four sails brings the ship to the speed of 70 knots, and she sails for 2 hours using four sails. Under the same conditions, sailing with one reefed sail brings her ship to the speed of 15 knots, and she sails for 4 hours with a reefed sail. Under the same conditions, the use of two sails while carrying extra cargo brings her ship to the speed of 40 knots, and she sails for 1 hour using two sails with the extra cargo. Under the same conditions, the use of one sail with a favorable current brings her ship to the speed of 30 knots, and she sails for 2 hours with that setup. Under the same conditions, if she lowers all sails and just drifts, her ship moves at 5 knots, and she drifts for 4 hours. what is the total distance, in land miles, that she will travel?",782.0," First, we need to convert the speeds from knots to land miles per hour. 

1 knot = 1.15 land miles per hour.

So, the speeds in land miles per hour are:

- With one sail: 25 knots = 25 * 1.15 = 28.75 land miles per hour
- With two sails: 50 knots = 50 * 1.15 = 57.5 land miles per hour
- With three sails: 60 knots = 60 * 1.15 = 69 land miles per hour
- With four sails: 70 knots = 70 * 1.15 = 80.5 land miles per hour
- With one reefed sail: 15 knots = 15 * 1.15 = 17.25 land miles per hour
- With two sails with extra cargo: 40 knots = 40 * 1.15 = 46 land miles per hour
- With one sail with a favorable current: 30 knots = 30 * 1.15 = 34.5 land miles per hour
- Drifting: 5 knots = 5 * 1.15 = 5.75 land miles per hour

Next, we calculate the distances traveled in each scenario:

- With one sail for 4 hours: 28.75 * 4 = 115 land miles
- With two sails for 4 hours: 57.5 * 4 = 230 land miles
- With three sails for 1 hour: 69 * 1 = 69 land miles
- With four sails for 2 hours: 80.5 * 2 = 161 land miles
- With one reefed sail for 4 hours: 17.25 * 4 = 69 land miles
- With two sails with extra cargo for 1 hour: 46 * 1 = 46 land miles
- With one sail with a favorable current for 2 hours: 34.5 * 2 = 69 land miles
- Drifting for 4 hours: 5.75 * 4 = 23 land miles

Finally, we add up all the distances:

115 + 230 + 69 + 161 + 69 + 46 + 69 + 23 = 777 land miles

Another friend, Gus, will only taste lasagna and eat one-fourth of what Manny eats, and Kai will finish whatever Gus leaves of his piece. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",16.0," Let's break down the problem and calculate how much lasagna each person will eat:

1. Manny: 1 piece
2. Aaron: 0 pieces
3. Kai: 2 * Manny's piece = 2 * 1 = 2 pieces
4. Raphael: Manny's piece / 2 = 1 / 2 = 0.5 pieces
5. Lisa: 2 pieces + Raphael's leftovers = 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 pieces
6. Nora: Manny's piece / 3 = 1 / 3 = 0.33 pieces
7. Ben: Kai's piece = 2 pieces
8. Tina: 3 pieces
9. Omar: Kai's piece / 2 = 2 / 2 = 1 piece
10. Zoe: Manny's piece + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 pieces
11. Gus: Manny's piece / 4 = 1 / 4 = 0.25 pieces

Now, let's add up all the pieces that each person will eat:

Total pieces = Manny's piece + Aaron's pieces + Kai's pieces + Raphael's pieces + Lisa's pieces + Nora's pieces + Ben's pieces + Tina's pieces + Omar's pieces + Zoe's pieces + Gus's pieces

Total pieces = 1 + 0 + 2 + 0.5 + 2.5 + 0.33 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 0.25
