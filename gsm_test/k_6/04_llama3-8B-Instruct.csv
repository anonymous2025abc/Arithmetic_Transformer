There were also 2 more hippos than one-fifth as many antelopes. What is the total number of animals that Josie counted?",1418.0,"Let's start by calculating the number of rabbits. The number of rabbits is 34 more than the number of antelopes, which is 80. So the number of rabbits is 80 + 34 = 114.

The number of hyenas is 42 fewer than the total number of antelopes and rabbits combined. The total number of antelopes and rabbits is 80 + 114 = 194. So the number of hyenas is 194 - 42 = 152.

The number of wild dogs is 50 more than the number of hyenas, which is 152. So the number of wild dogs is 152 + 50 = 202.

The number of leopards is half the number of rabbits, which is 114. So the number of leopards is 114 / 2 = 57.

The number of zebras is twice the number of leopards, which is 57. So the number of zebras is 57 * 2 = 114.

The number of giraffes is 3 fewer than the number of zebras, which is 114. So the number of giraffes is 114 - 3 = 111.

The number of buffaloes is half the number of antelopes and rabbits combined, which is 194. So the number of buffaloes is 194 / 2 = 97.

The number of monkeys is two-thirds the number of rabbits and leopards combined, which is 114 + 57 = 171. So the number of monkeys is 171 * 2/3 = 114.

The number of elephants is 5 more than the total number of wild dogs and hyenas combined, which is 202 + 152 = 354. So the number of elephants is 354 + 5 = 359.

The number of hippos is 2 more than one-fifth the number of antelopes, which is 80. So the number of hippos is 80 / 5 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18.

From the information given about blue marbles, we know that Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. So Anie collected 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles.

From the information given about Tom, we know that Tom collected 5 fewer blue marbles than Jenny. So Tom collected 25 - 5 = 20 blue marbles.

2 15-oz bottles of orange soda = 2 * 15 = 30 oz

3 scoops of sherbet that weigh 10 oz each = 3 * 10 = 30 oz
2 cups of pineapple chunks that weigh 10 oz per cup = 2 * 10 = 20 oz

Total volume = 72 + 28 + 40 + 30 + 20 + 20 + 50 = 240 oz

Now let's find out how many pieces of bread each person brought. Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread. Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats, so she brings 75% of 100% = 75%. Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, so she brings 3 * 50% = 150%. Carlos brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats, so he brings 2 * 33% = 66%.

Since 1 knot is equal to 1 nautical mile per hour, we can use the speeds given in knots directly. 

Now, let's calculate the distance traveled in nautical miles for each segment of the trip:

1. With one sail: 4 hours * 25 knots = 100 nautical miles
2. With two sails: 4 hours * 50 knots = 200 nautical miles
3. With three sails: 1 hour * 60 knots = 60 nautical miles
4. With four sails: 2 hours * 70 knots = 140 nautical miles
5. With a reefed sail: 4 hours * 15 knots = 60 nautical miles
6. With two sails and extra cargo: 1 hour * 40 knots = 40 nautical miles
7. With one sail and a favorable current: 2 hours * 30 knots = 60 nautical miles
8. Drifting: 4 hours * 5 knots = 20 nautical miles

Now, we need to convert the distances from nautical miles to land miles. Since 1 nautical mile is equal to 1.15 land miles, we can multiply the distances in nautical miles by 1.15:

1. With one sail: 100 nautical miles * 1.15 = 115 land miles
2. With two sails: 200 nautical miles * 1.15 = 230 land miles
3. With three sails: 60 nautical miles * 1.15 = 69 land miles
4. With four sails: 140 nautical miles * 1.15 = 161 land miles
5. With a reefed sail: 60 nautical miles * 1.15 = 69 land miles
6. With two sails and extra cargo: 40 nautical miles * 1.15 = 46 land miles
7. With one sail and a favorable current: 60 nautical miles * 1.15 = 69 land miles
8. Drifting: 20 nautical miles * 1.15 = 23 land miles

Now, we can add up the distances to get the total distance traveled:
