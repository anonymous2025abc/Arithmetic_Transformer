Alice has 5 times as many sheep as Bob. Bob has 3 times as many sheep as David. David has 2 times as many sheep as Zoe. Zoe has 4 times as many sheep as John. John has 5 times as many sheep as Rachel. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle, Alice, Bob, David, Zoe, John and Rachel have together if Rachel has 20 sheep?",327720.0,"Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of sheep in each city as follows: T = Toulouse, C = Charleston, S = Seattle, A = Alice, B = Bob, D = David, Z = Zoe, J = John, and R = Rachel.

2. We know that R = 20.

3. Since Rachel has 5 times as many sheep as Rachel, we can find the number of sheep in Rachel by dividing the number of sheep in Rachel by 5: R / 5 = 4.

4. Since Zoe has 4 times as many sheep as John, we can find the number of sheep in John by dividing the number of sheep in Zoe by 4: Z / 4 = 0.5 (rounded down to 0 since we can't have a fraction of a sheep).

5. Since David has 2 times as many sheep as Zoe, we can find the number of sheep in Zoe by multiplying the number of sheep in David by 2: D * 2 = Z.

6. Since Bob has 3 times as many sheep as David, we can find the number of sheep in David by dividing the number of sheep in Bob by 3: B / 3 = D.

7. Since Alice has 5 times as many sheep as Bob, we can find the number of sheep in Bob by dividing the number of sheep in Alice by 5: A / 5 = B.

8. Since Seattle has 2 times as many sheep as Alice, we can find the number of sheep in Alice by dividing the number of sheep in Seattle by 2: S / 2 = A.

9. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, we can find the number of sheep in Seattle by dividing the number of sheep in Charleston by 4: C / 4 = S.

10. Finally, since Toulouse has 2 times as many sheep as Charleston, we can find the number of sheep in Charleston by multiplying the number of sheep in Toulouse by 2: T * 2 = C.

11. Now that we have the number of sheep in each city, we can add them up to find the total number of sheep: T + C + S + A + B + D + Z + J + R.

Plugging in the values we found:

T = C * 2 = (S * 4) * 2 = (A * 2 * 4) * 2 = (B * 2 * 4 * 2) * 2 = (D * 2 * 4 * 2 * 2) * 2 = (Z * 2 * 4 * 2 * 2 * 2) * 2 = (J * 2 * 4 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2) * 2 + 20

Since we don't have a specific value for T, we can't find the exact number of sheep in all cities. However, we can express the total number of sheep in terms of T:

T + C + S + A + B + D + Z + J + R = T * 2 + (T * 2) * 4 + (T * 2) * 2 + (T * 2) * (2 * 4) + (T * 2) * (2 * 4) * 2 + (T * 2) * (2 * 4) * 2 * 2 + (T * 2) * (2 * 4) * 2 * 2 * 2 + (T * 2) * (2 * 4) * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 + 20

This expression gives us the total number of sheep in all cities in terms of the number of sheep in Toulouse.",20,20.0,False,

The Sunset is 2 times as old as the Crestwood. The Golden Acre is 4 times as old as the Twin Valley. If the Carlo Rosi is 40 years old, what is the total age of all the listed wines?",530.0,"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Let's denote the age of Twin Valley as TV.
2. The Carlo Rosi (CR) is four times as old as the Twin Valley, so CR = 4 * TV.
3. The Franzia (F) is three times as old as the Carlo Rosi, so F = 3 * CR = 3 * (4 * TV) = 12 * TV.
4. The Silver Ridge (SR) is the same age as the Franzia, so SR = F = 12 * TV.
5. The Old Vine (OV) is 2 times as old as the Twin Valley, so OV = 2 * TV.
6. The Barrel Hill (BH) is 3 times as old as the Old Vine, so BH = 3 * OV = 3 * (2 * TV) = 6 * TV.
7. The Crestwood (CW) is the same age as the Carlo Rosi, so CW = CR = 4 * TV.
8. The Sunset (SS) is 2 times as old as the Crestwood, so SS = 2 * CW = 2 * (4 * TV) = 8 * TV.
9. The Golden Acre (GA) is 4 times as old as the Twin Valley, so GA = 4 * TV.

Now we have the ages of all the wines in terms of TV. To find the total age of all the wines, we simply add up their ages:

Total Age = TV (Twin Valley) + CR (Carlo Rosi) + F (Franzia) + SR (Silver Ridge) + OV (Old Vine) + BH (Barrel Hill) + CW (Crestwood) + SS (Sunset) + GA (Golden Acre)

Substitute the ages from our previous calculations:

Total Age = TV + (4 * TV) + (12 * TV) + (12 * TV) + (2 * TV) + (6 * TV) + (4 * TV) + (8 * TV) + (4 * TV)

Combine the terms:

Total Age = 40 + 36 * TV

Since we know that the Carlo Rosi is 40 years old, we can find the age of the Twin Valley (TV) by subtracting 40 from the total age of the Carlo Rosi:

TV = (Total Age - 40) / 36

Now we have an equation for the age of the Twin Valley in terms of the total age. To find the total age of all the wines, we can substitute TV back into our Total Age equation:

Total Age = 40 + 36 * ((Total Age - 40) / 36)

Solving this equation for Total Age will give us the total age of all the listed wines. However, it's not possible to solve this equation analytically, so we would need to use numerical methods or a calculator to find the solution.

After finding the solution, we can express the total age as:

There were also two-thirds as many monkeys as rabbits and leopards combined. There were also 5 more elephants than the total number of wild dogs and hyenas combined. There were also 2 more hippos than one-fifth as many antelopes. What is the total number of animals that Josie counted?",1418.0,"This is a complex problem that requires multiple steps to solve. Let's break it down:

1. Let's denote the number of rabbits as R, antelopes as A, hyenas as H, wild dogs as W, leopards as L, zebras as Z, buffaloes as B, monkeys as M, elephants as E, and hippos as Hp.

2. From the problem, we have the following equations:

   a) R = 34 + A (Equation 1)
   b) A + R = 80 (Equation 2)
   c) H = A + R - 42 (Equation 3)
   d) W = H + 50 (Equation 4)
   e) L = R/2 (Equation 5)
   f) Z = 2L + 3 (Equation 6)
   g) B = A + R (Equation 7)
   h) M = (R + L)/2 (Equation 8)
   i) E = W + H + 5 (Equation 9)
   j) Hp = 5A/4 (Equation 10)

3. We can solve Equation 2 for A: A = 80 - R

4. Substitute A from Equation 4 into Equation 1: R = 34 + (80 - R)

5. Solve for R: R = 42

6. Substitute R and A into Equations 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 to find the values for H, L, W, Z, B, M, E, and Hp.

1. Micah has 7 fish.
2. Kenneth has 3 times as many fish as Micah, so Kenneth has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.
3. Matthias has 15 fewer fish than Kenneth, so Matthias has 21 - 15 = 6 fish.
4. Noah has 7 times as many fish as Micah, so Noah has 7 * 7 = 49 fish.
5. Liam has 5 fewer fish than Kenneth, so Liam has 21 - 5 = 16 fish.

How many more points did the Fireflies score in the game than did the Hornets?",20.0,"To find the total points scored by each team, we need to calculate the points scored during each segment of the game and sum them up.

First, let's calculate the points scored by the Fireflies:
- In the first 5 seconds: 7 * 3 (three-point baskets) = 21 points
- In the next 3 seconds: 1 * 2 (two-point baskets) = 2 points
- In the next 8 seconds: 3 * 2 (two-point baskets) = 6 points

1. Jane brings 100% of treats (let's call this T_J), so 75% of bread (B_J) would be 0.75 * T_J.

2. Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane (T_W = 0.5 * T_J), and three times as many pieces of bread as treats (B_W = 3 * T_W).

3. Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane (T_C = 0.33 * T_J), and twice as many pieces of bread as treats (B_C = 2 * T_C).

4. Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda (T_M = T_W - 10), and half as many pieces of bread as treats (B_M = 0.5 * T_M).

5. Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda (T_O = 1.5 * T_W), and four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats (B_O = 4/5 * T_O).

7. Elena brings 5 more treats than Mia (T_E = T_M + 5), and three times as many pieces of bread as treats (B_E = 3 * T_E).

8. Ben brings half as many treats as Jane (T_B = 0.5 * T_J), and three-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats (B_B = 3/5 * T_B).

Since Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, we can find T_W and then solve for the other quantities.

B_W = 90, so T_W = B_W / 3 = 30.

Now we can find the other quantities:

- T_J = 30 * 2 = 60 treats
- T_C = 30 * 0.33 = 9.9 (rounding to T_C = 10 treats)
- T_M = 30 - 10 = 20 treats
- T_O = 30 * 1.5 = 45 treats
- T_P = 10 * 2 = 20 treats
- T_E = 20 + 5 = 25 treats
- T_B = 60 / 2 = 30 treats

Next, let's find the pieces of bread:

- B_J = 0.75 * 60 = 45 pieces of bread
- B_W = 30
- B_C = 10
- B_M = 20 / 2 = 10 pieces of bread
- B_O = (4/5 * 45) / 1.5 = 30 pieces of bread

- B_E = 25 * 3 = 75 pieces of bread
- B_B = (30 * 3) / 5 = 36 pieces of bread

Now we can sum up the total number of pieces of bread and treats:

Total pieces of bread = 45 + 30 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 30 + 5 + 36 + 75 = 221 pieces of bread
Total treats = 60 + 30 + 10 + 20 + 45 + 20 + 25 + 30 = 235 treats

If Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers, how many rehabilitation centers did they all visit in total, assuming they are all different?",107.0,"Let's break this down by finding the number of rehabilitation centers visited by each person and then summing them up.

1. Jane visited 2 * (number of centers visited by Han) + 6.
2. Han visited (number of centers visited by Jude) - 2.
3. Jude visited half the number of centers visited by Lisa, so Jude visited (2 * number of centers visited by Lisa).
4. Omar visited (number of centers visited by Jude) + 3.
5. Priya visited 3 times the number of centers visited by Han, so Priya visited 3 * (number of centers visited by Han) - 1.
6. Chen visited twice the number of centers visited by Lisa, so Chen visited 2 * (number of centers visited by Lisa) * 2.
7. Nia visited twice the number of centers visited by Jane, so Nia visited 2 * (2 * (number of centers visited by Han) + 6) - 4.
8. Luis visited half the number of centers visited by Nia, so Luis visited (Nia's centers) / 2 + 5.
9. Tasha visited twice the number of centers visited by Omar, so Tasha visited 2 * (number of centers visited by Jude) + 3.

Since Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers, we can find the number of centers visited by Han, Jude, Omar, and the rest by using the given relationships.

1. Han visited (Jane's centers - 6) / 5.
2. Jude visited (Lisa's centers) / 2.
3. Omar visited (Jude's centers) - 3.
4. Nia visited 2 * (Jane's centers) - 4.
5. Luis visited (Nia's centers) / 2 + 5.
6. Tasha visited 2 * (Omar's centers).

Now we can find the total number of centers visited by all:

Total centers = Jane's centers + Han's centers + Jude's centers + Omar's centers + Priya's centers + Chen's centers + Nia's centers + Luis' centers + Tasha's centers

After calculating all the values, we get the total number of centers visited by all to be 54.

1. The pencil is 12 cm long.
2. A marker is 1 cm longer than the pencil, so it is 13 cm long.
3. The pen is longer than the rubber by 3 cm, and shorter than the pencil by 2 cm. So, the pen is 12 - 2 + 3 = 13 - 2 + 3 = 14 cm long. Since the rubber is shorter than the pen by an unknown amount, let's call the length of the rubber x cm.
4. The pencil is shorter than the ruler by an unknown amount, but we know the ruler is twice as long as the pencil, so the ruler is 2 * 12 = 24 cm long.
5. The paintbrush is 3 cm longer than the pen, so it is 14 + 3 = 17 cm long.
6. The stylus is half as long as the ruler, so it is 24 / 2 = 12 cm long.
7. The paperclip chain is 4 cm shorter than the stylus, so it is 12 - 4 = 8 cm long.
8. The crayon is 2 cm shorter than the rubber, so the rubber is x + 2 cm long.

1. Last night: Apples = 3, Bananas = 1, Oranges = 4, Pears = 2, Peaches = 3, Grapes = 8, Plums = 5, Strawberries = 10, Kiwis = 4

2. Today:
   - Apples: A = 4 + 4(last night's apples) = 4 + 4(3) = 19
   - Bananas: B = 10 * last night's bananas = 10 * 1 = 10
   - Oranges: O = 2 * A (since O = 2A)
   - Pears: P = A - 2 (since P = A - 2)
   - Peaches: Q = 3 * last night's peaches = 3 * 3 = 9
   - Grapes: G = (1/2) * O (since G = (1/2) * O)
   - Plums: R = 1 + B (since R = 1 + B)
   - Strawberries: S = 2 * P (since S = 2 * P)
   - Kiwis: K = A + B - 3 (since K = A + B - 3)

3. To find the total number of fruits for the two meals, we add the fruits from last night and the fruits she'll eat today:

   - Total Fruits = Last night's fruits + Today's fruits

4. We still need to find the number of oranges (O) to complete the calculation for today's fruits. Since O = 2A, we can substitute A with 19 (the number of apples she'll have today) to find O:

   - O = 2 * 19 = 38

6. We still need to find the number of plums (P), bananas (B), and kiwis (K). Since P = A - 2, B = 10, and K = A + B - 3, we can substitute A with 19 to find P and K:

   - P = 19 - 2 = 17
   - K = 19 + 10 - 3 = 28

2. Oranges: The total produce of oranges was 200 kg more than that of mangoes, so there were 400 + 200 = 600 kg of oranges.

3. Bananas: He produced 100 kg fewer bananas than apples, so there were 800 - 100 = 700 kg of bananas.

The family buys 2 guest passes each month at $30 each. There is a one-time processing fee of $500 for the whole family. They rent lockers for 3 of the members at $120 per locker for the year. They spend $200 every quarter on club events for the family. John agrees to pay half the total cost for the whole family. How much does John pay for the first year?,35590.0,"First, let's calculate the one-time costs:

1. Family processing fee: $500 (one-time)
2. Locker rentals for 3 members: 3 * $120 = $360 (annual)

Next, let's calculate the annual costs per person:

1. Joining fee: $4000
2. Monthly cost: $1000 * 12 = $12,000
3. Annual maintenance fee: $600
4. Gym access: $50 * 12 = $600
5. Guest passes (2 per month * 12 months): 2 * $30 * 12 = $720

Now, let's calculate the total annual cost for the family:

Total annual cost for the family = (4 members * [joining fee + monthly cost + annual maintenance fee + gym access + guest passes]) + one-time processing fee + locker rentals + club events
Total annual cost for the family = (4 * ($4000 + $12,000 + $600 + $600 + $720)) + $500 + $360 + $200 * 4
Total annual cost for the family = $1,920,000 + $500 + $360 + $800
Total annual cost for the family = $1,920,866

Since John agrees to pay half the total cost, his share for the first year is:

John's share = Total annual cost for the family / 2
John's share = $1,920,866 / 2
John's share = $960,433

Final answer: John pays $960,433 for the first year.","960,433",960433.0,False,

1. Safari National park has 100 lions, half as many snakes (100/2 = 50 snakes), and 10 fewer giraffes than snakes (50 - 10 = 40 giraffes). It also has twice as many zebras as giraffes (40 * 2 = 80 zebras).

2. Savanna National park has double the number of lions as Safari National park (100 * 2 = 200 lions), triple the number of snakes (50 * 3 = 150 snakes), and 20 more giraffes (40 + 20 = 60 giraffes). It has half as many zebras as lions (200 / 2 = 100 zebras).

3. Safari National park has 5 fewer elephants than snakes (50 - 5 = 45 elephants), and Savanna National park has 20 more elephants (45 + 20 = 65 elephants).

4. Safari National park has three times as many monkeys as giraffes (40 * 3 = 120 monkeys), and Savanna National park has 10 fewer monkeys than zebras (100 - 10 = 90 monkeys).

5. Safari National park has as many hippos as elephants (45), and Savanna National park has 5 more hippos than its crocodiles. Since Savanna National park has twice as many crocodiles as Safari National park (lions), it has (2 * 100 = 200) crocodiles. So, Savanna National park has 5 more hippos than 200 - 5 = 195 crocodiles, making the number of hippos 195 + 5 = 200.

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in Savanna National park:

- Snakes: 150
- Giraffes: 60
- Zebras: 100
- Elephants: 65
- Monkeys: 90
- Hippos: 200
- Crocodiles: 200
- Flamingos: 3 * (100 * 3) = 900 (since Savanna National park has one-third as many flamingos as Safari National park)

1. Manny: 1 piece (since he only wants one)

3. Kai: 2 * Manny's pieces (since he eats twice as much as Manny)
4. Raphael: Raphael eats half of Manny's piece, and Lisa eats the rest of Raphael's piece if there's any left. So, Raphael eats 0.5 * Manny's pieces.
5. Lisa: Lisa eats 2 pieces (one from Raphael and whatever Nora leaves of her piece) and whatever Nora leaves of her piece. Let's calculate Nora's portion first.
6. Nora: Nora eats 1/3 of Manny's pieces.
7. Tina: Tina eats 3 pieces.
8. Omar: Omar eats half as much as Kai, so Omar eats 0.5 * Kai's pieces.

Total Lasagna = Manny's pieces + Kai's pieces + Omar's pieces + Zoe's pieces + Ben's pieces + Gus's pieces (that Kai eats)

Total Lasagna = 1 + 2 * Manny + 0.5 * Manny + Manny + 1 + 0.25 * Manny

Now, let's find the cost for women's t-shirts. Since women's t-shirts are $5 cheaper than men's t-shirts of the same color, we can subtract $5 from the cost of men's t-shirts for each color.

For white women's t-shirts, the cost is $20 - $5 = $15.
For black women's t-shirts, the cost is $18 - $5 = $13.
For blue women's t-shirts, the cost is $22 - $5 = $17.

2. Kenley has twice as many as McKenna, so Kenley has 34 * 2 = 68 stuffed animals.
3. Tenly has 5 more than Kenley, so Tenly has 68 + 5 = 73 stuffed animals.
4. Riley has 10 fewer stuffed animals than Tenly, so Riley has 73 - 10 = 63 stuffed animals.
5. Avery has half as many stuffed animals as Kenley, so Avery has 68 / 2 = 34 stuffed animals (same as McKenna).
6. Casey has 7 more stuffed animals than Avery, so Casey has 34 + 7 = 41 stuffed animals.
7. Morgan has as many stuffed animals as Riley and Casey have combined, so Morgan has 63 (Riley) + 41 (Casey) = 104 stuffed animals.
8. Jordan has 3 times as many stuffed animals as McKenna, so Jordan has 34 * 3 = 102 stuffed animals.
9. Peyton has 2 fewer stuffed animals than McKenna, so Peyton has 34 - 2 = 32 stuffed animals.

Now, let's find out how many stuffed animals all the people mentioned have in all:

McKenna: 34
Kenley: 68
Tenly: 73
Riley: 63
Avery: 34
Casey: 41
Morgan: 104
Jordan: 102
Peyton: 32

All together, they have 34 + 68 + 73 + 63 + 34 + 41 + 104 + 102 + 32 = 599 stuffed animals.

1. Jessica, Tori, Lily, Patrice, Ava, Monique, Ben, Charlotte, Ian, and Zoe have 10 friends in total.
2. Each jelly bracelet costs $2.
3. To find the total amount, multiply the number of friends by the cost of each bracelet: 10 * $2 = $<<10*2=20>>20

1,mistral-7b,mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3,6,49,48,Monroe has a collection of ants and a collection of spiders. He has 8 spiders and 12 ants. He also has 5 beetles. He also has 3 scorpions. He also has 10 crickets. He also has 2 crabs. He also has 7 ladybugs. He also has 4 tarantulas. What is the total number of legs in his entire collection?,344.0,"To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of creature and then add them up.

1. Spiders have 8 legs each, so 8 spiders have 8 * 8 = 64 legs.
2. Ants have 6 legs each, so 12 ants have 12 * 6 = 72 legs.
3. Beetles have 6 legs each, so 5 beetles have 5 * 6 = 30 legs.
4. Scorpions have 4 legs each, so 3 scorpions have 3 * 4 = 12 legs.
5. Crickets have 6 legs each, so 10 crickets have 10 * 6 = 60 legs.
6. Crabs have 10 legs each (including the pincers), so 2 crabs have 2 * 10 = 20 legs.
7. Ladybugs have 6 legs each, so 7 ladybugs have 7 * 6 = 42 legs.
8. Tarantulas have 8 legs each, so 4 tarantulas have 4 * 8 = 32 legs.

Now, let's add up the total number of legs:

64 (spiders) + 72 (ants) + 30 (beetles) + 12 (scorpions) + 60 (crickets) + 20 (crabs) + 42 (ladybugs) + 32 (tarantulas) = 320 legs

So, the total number of legs in Monroe's collection is 320.",320,320.0,False,

For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs. The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs. The machine has twice as many orange gumballs as blue gumballs. The machine has one-fourth as many pink gumballs as green gumballs. The machine has as many white gumballs as the total number of yellow and blue gumballs combined. The machine has 5 more brown gumballs than purple gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",135.0,"Let's break this down step by step:

1. The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs, so it has 16/2 = 8 blue gumballs.

2. For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. So, the machine has 8 * 4 = 32 green gumballs.

3. The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs, so it has 8 yellow gumballs.

4. The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs, so it has 16 - 3 = 13 purple gumballs.

5. The machine has twice as many orange gumballs as blue gumballs, so it has 8 * 2 = 16 orange gumballs.

6. The machine has one-fourth as many pink gumballs as green gumballs, so it has 32 / 4 = 8 pink gumballs.

7. The machine has as many white gumballs as the total number of yellow and blue gumballs combined, so it has 8 (yellow) + 8 (blue) = 16 white gumballs.

8. The machine has 5 more brown gumballs than purple gumballs, so it has 13 (purple) + 5 = 18 brown gumballs.

Now, we need to find the total number of gumballs. We know the number of each type of gumball, but we don't have a direct way to add them all up. However, we can find the total number of yellow and blue gumballs, which is the number of white gumballs:

9. The machine has 16 white gumballs, and we know that these are the total number of yellow and blue gumballs. So, the machine has 16 - 8 (blue) = 8 yellow gumballs.

10. Now, we can add up all the gumballs: 16 (red) + 8 (blue) + 32 (green) + 8 (yellow) + 13 (purple) + 16 (orange) + 8 (pink) + 16 (white) + 18 (brown) = 128 gumballs.

So, the final answer is 128.",128,128.0,False,
