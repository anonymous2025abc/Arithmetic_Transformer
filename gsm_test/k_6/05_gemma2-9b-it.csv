2. **Zoe:** Zoe has 4 times as many sheep as John, who has 100. So Zoe has 4 * 100 = 400 sheep.

3. **David:** David has 2 times as many sheep as Zoe, who has 400. So David has 2 * 400 = 800 sheep.

4. **Bob:** Bob has 3 times as many sheep as David, who has 800. So Bob has 3 * 800 = 2400 sheep.

5. **Alice:** Alice has 5 times as many sheep as Bob, who has 2400. So Alice has 5 * 2400 = 12000 sheep.

6. **Seattle:** Seattle has 2 times as many sheep as Alice, who has 12000. So Seattle has 2 * 12000 = 24000 sheep.

7. **Charleston:** Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, who has 24000. So Charleston has 4 * 24000 = 96000 sheep.

8. **Toulouse:** Toulouse has 2 times as many sheep as Charleston, who has 96000. So Toulouse has 2 * 96000 = 192000 sheep.

**1. Calculate individual contributions:**

* **Jane:**
    * Treats: 75% of Wanda's treats = 0.75 * 90 = 67.5 treats
    * Bread: 75% of Wanda's bread = 0.75 * 90 = 67.5 pieces

* **Carlos:**
    * Treats: (1/3) * Jane's treats = (1/3) * 67.5 = 22.5 treats
    * Bread: 2 * Carlos' treats = 2 * 22.5 = 45 pieces
* **Mia:**

They also have a younger brother named Mason who is 1 year younger than Ethan. They also have a younger brother named Lucas who is 1 year younger than Mason. How old is the youngest brother?,25.0,"Here's how to solve the problem:

**1. Find the ages of the three oldest brothers:**

* Let the youngest of the three oldest brothers be represented by  'x'.
* The next oldest brother is 'x + 1'.
* The oldest brother is 'x + 2'.
* Their sum is x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 96
* Combining like terms: 3x + 3 = 96
* Subtracting 3 from both sides: 3x = 93
* Dividing both sides by 3: x = 31

**2. Find the ages of the younger brothers:**

* Liam: x + 1 = 31 + 1 = 32
* Noah: Liam - 1 = 32 - 1 = 31
* Owen: Noah - 1 = 31 - 1 = 30
* Ethan: Owen - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29
* Mason: Ethan - 1 = 29 - 1 = 28
* Lucas: Mason - 1 = 28 - 1 = 27

Another competitor, Jamal, got 4 fewer questions correct than Maya and twice as many questions wrong as Noah. If each competitor was asked a different question, how many questions were asked in the competition?",184.0,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Carla's wrong answers:** Carla got twice as many questions wrong as Drew, who got 6 wrong. So Carla got 2 * 6 = 12 questions wrong.

2. **Maya's answers:** Maya got 3 fewer questions correct than Drew (20 - 3 = 17) and 2 more questions wrong than Drew (6 + 2 = 8).

3. **Eli's answers:** Eli got 5 more questions correct than Carla (14 + 5 = 19) and half as many questions wrong as Carla (12 / 2 = 6).

4. **Sasha's answers:** Sasha got twice as many questions correct as Drew got wrong (2 * 6 = 12) and 4 fewer questions wrong than Carla (12 - 4 = 8).

5. **Noah's answers:** Noah got the same number of questions correct as Carla (14) and 3 fewer questions wrong than Drew (6 - 3 = 3).

6. **Priya's answers:** Priya got 2 fewer questions correct than Eli (19 - 2 = 17) and 1 more question wrong than Sasha (8 + 1 = 9).

7. **Jamal's answers:** Jamal got 4 fewer questions correct than Maya (17 - 4 = 13) and twice as many questions wrong as Noah (3 * 2 = 6).

8. **Total questions:** Add up the number of questions each competitor got correct: 20 + 14 + 17 + 12 + 19 + 12 + 14 + 17 + 13 = 148

   Since each competitor was asked a different question, the total number of questions asked in the competition is 148.

He bought 6 kilos of potatoes for $2 per kilo, 9 kilos of tomato for $3 per kilo, 5 kilos of cucumbers for $4 per kilo, and 3 kilos of bananas for $5 per kilo. He also bought 4 kilos of rice for $6 per kilo, 2 kilos of onions for $3 per kilo, 5 kilos of apples for $4 per kilo, 3 kilos of chicken for $8 per kilo, 10 loaves of bread for $2 each, 2 bottles of olive oil for $11 each. How much is Peter's remaining money?",310.0,"Here's how to break down the problem to find Peter's remaining money:

**1. Calculate the cost of each item:**

* Potatoes: 6 kilos * $2/kilo = $12
* Tomatoes: 9 kilos * $3/kilo = $27
* Cucumbers: 5 kilos * $4/kilo = $20
* Bananas: 3 kilos * $5/kilo = $15
* Rice: 4 kilos * $6/kilo = $24
* Onions: 2 kilos * $3/kilo = $6
* Apples: 5 kilos * $4/kilo = $20
* Chicken: 3 kilos * $8/kilo = $24
* Bread: 10 loaves * $2/loaf = $20
* Olive Oil: 2 bottles * $11/bottle = $22

**2. Calculate the total spending:**

$12 + $27 + $20 + $15 + $24 + $6 + $20 + $24 + $20 + $22 = $190

**3. Calculate the remaining money:**

$500 - $190 = $310

* **Mell's order:** 2 coffee * $4/coffee + 1 cake * $7/cake = $8 + $7 = $15
* **Two friends' orders (coffee, cake, ice cream):** 2 * ($8 + 1 ice cream * $3/ice cream) = 2 * ($8 + $3) = 2 * $11 = $22
* **Nina's order:** $15 + 2 ice cream * $3/ice cream = $15 + $6 = $21
* **Two friends' orders (coffee, ice cream):** 2 * (1 coffee * $4/coffee + 2 ice cream * $3/ice cream) = 2 * ($4 + $6) = 2 * $10 = $20
* **Omar's order:** 3 coffee * $4/coffee + 1 cake * $7/cake = $12 + $7 = $19
* **Three friends' orders (coffee, cake):** 3 * (1 coffee * $4/coffee + 1 cake * $7/cake) = 3 * ($4 + $7) = 3 * $11 = $33
* **Ava's order:** 4 ice cream * $3/ice cream = $12

He needs to know how many pieces to cut the lasagna into to serve it. Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Another friend, Nora, is picky and will only eat one-third of what Manny eats, and Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. Another friend, Ben, will eat the same amount of lasagna as Kai. Another friend, Tina, loves lasagna and will eat 3 pieces. Another friend, Omar, will eat half as much as Kai. Another friend, Zoe, will eat one more piece of lasagna than Manny. Another friend, Gus, will only taste lasagna and eat one-fourth of what Manny eats, and Kai will finish whatever Gus leaves of his piece. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",16.0,"Here's how to break down the lasagna consumption:

* **Manny:** 1 piece
* **Kai:** 1 * 2 = 2 pieces
* **Raphael:** 1 / 2 = 0.5 pieces
* **Lisa:** 2 pieces + 0.5 pieces (Raphael's leftovers) = 2.5 pieces
* **Nora:** 1 / 3 = 0.33 pieces
* **Lisa:** 0.33 pieces (Nora's leftovers)
* **Ben:** 2 pieces (same as Kai)
* **Tina:** 3 pieces
* **Omar:** 2 / 2 = 1 piece
* **Zoe:** 1 + 1 = 2 pieces
* **Gus:** 1 / 4 = 0.25 pieces
* **Kai:** 0.25 pieces (Gus's leftovers)

**Total pieces:** 1 + 2 + 0.5 + 2.5 + 0.33 + 0.33 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 0.25 + 0.25 = **15.66 pieces**

Since you can't cut a lasagna into fractions of pieces, Manny should cut his lasagna into **16** pieces.

**2. Calculate the cost of t-shirts for each sector:**

* White sector: (10 men * $20) + (10 women * $15) = $200 + $150 = $350
* Black sector: (10 men * $18) + (10 women * $13) = $180 + $130 = $310
* Blue sector: (10 men * $22) + (10 women * $17) = $220 + $170 = $390
* Red sector: (10 men * $21) + (10 women * $16) = $210 + $160 = $370
