1. Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread. Since Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane, we need to find Jane's number of treats first. Let's denote Jane's number of treats as J. Then Wanda's number of treats is J/2. Since Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread and three times as many pieces of bread as treats, we can set up the equation 90 = 3 * (J/2). Solving for J, we get J = 60. So Jane brings 60 treats.

2. Since Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, and we know that Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, we can confirm that Wanda brings 90 = 3 * (J/2) = 3 * (60/2) = 90.

3. Now we can find the number of treats and pieces of bread that each person brings:

   - Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread (already given) and half as many treats as Jane, which is 60/2 = 30 treats.
   - Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane, which is 60/3 = 20 treats, and twice as many pieces of bread as treats, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pieces of bread.
   - Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda, which is 30 - 10 = 20 treats, and half as many pieces of bread as treats, which is 20/2 = 10 pieces of bread.
   - Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda, which is 1.5 * 30 = 45 treats, and four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats, which is 4/5 * 90 = 72 pieces of bread.
   - Priya brings twice as many treats as Carlos, which is 2 * 20 = 40 treats, and one-fourth as many pieces of bread as treats, which is 20/4 = 5 pieces of bread.
   - Elena brings 5 more treats than Mia, which is 20 + 5 = 25 treats, and three times as many pieces of bread as treats, which is 3 * 20 = 60 pieces of bread.
   - Ben brings half as many treats as Jane, which is 60/2 = 30 treats, and three-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats, which is 3/5 * 45 = 27 pieces of bread.

Now we can add up the number of treats and pieces of bread that everyone brought:

Total legs seen so far: 48 + 32 + 20 + 16 + 24 + 24 + 16 + 48 + 24 = 240 legs

Tarantulas have 8 legs each. To find out how many tarantulas Borgnine needs to see, we divide the remaining legs by 8:
860 / 8 = 107.5

Since you can't see half a tarantula, we round up to the nearest whole number.

So, 107.5 is actually 107 tarantulas and a half tarantula. However, since you can't see half a tarantula, we can see 107 tarantulas and then see 4 more legs to meet the goal.

How old is the youngest brother?,25.0,"To find the age of the youngest brother, we need to first find the ages of the three oldest brothers. 

Let's denote the age of the youngest of the three oldest brothers as x. 

Since the ages of the three oldest brothers are consecutive integers, the ages of the other two brothers will be x + 1 and x + 2.

We are given that the sum of the ages of the three oldest brothers is 96. 

So, we can write the equation: 
x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 96

Combine like terms: 
3x + 3 = 96

Subtract 3 from both sides: 
3x = 93

Divide both sides by 3: 
x = 31

Now that we know the age of the youngest of the three oldest brothers is 31, we can find the age of Liam, who is 1 year younger than the youngest of the three oldest brothers. 
Liam's age = 31 - 1 = 30

We can continue this process to find the ages of the other brothers: 
Noah's age = 30 - 1 = 29
Owen's age = 29 - 1 = 28
Ethan's age = 28 - 1 = 27
Mason's age = 27 - 1 = 26
Lucas's age = 26 - 1 = 25

The youngest brother is Lucas, and his age is 25.

Savanna National park has three times as many flamingos as Safari National park. Safari National park also has as many hippos as elephants. Savanna National park has 5 more hippos than its crocodiles. How many animals in total does Savanna National park have?",840.0,"To find the total number of animals in Savanna National park, we need to calculate the number of each type of animal and add them together.

1. Lions: Savanna National park has double as many lions as Safari National park. 
   Safari National park has 100 lions. 
   So, Savanna National park has 2 * 100 = 200 lions.

2. Snakes: Savanna National park has triple as many snakes as Safari National park. 
   Safari National park has half as many snakes as lions. 
   So, Safari National park has 100 / 2 = 50 snakes. 
   Savanna National park has 3 * 50 = 150 snakes.

3. Giraffes: Savanna National park has 20 more giraffes than Safari National park. 
   Safari National park has 10 fewer giraffes than snakes. 
   So, Safari National park has 50 - 10 = 40 giraffes. 
   Savanna National park has 40 + 20 = 60 giraffes.

4. Zebras: Savanna National park has half as many zebras as lions. 
   So, Savanna National park has 200 / 2 = 100 zebras.

5. Elephants: Savanna National park has 20 more elephants than Safari National park. 
   Safari National park has 5 fewer elephants than snakes. 
   So, Safari National park has 50 - 5 = 45 elephants. 
   Savanna National park has 45 + 20 = 65 elephants.

6. Monkeys: Savanna National park has 10 fewer monkeys than its zebras. 
   So, Savanna National park has 100 - 10 = 90 monkeys.

7. Crocodiles: Savanna National park has twice as many crocodiles as Safari National park. 
   Safari National park has one-fifth as many crocodiles as lions. 
   So, Safari National park has 100 / 5 = 20 crocodiles. 
   Savanna National park has 2 * 20 = 40 crocodiles.

8. Flamingos: Savanna National park has three times as many flamingos as Safari National park. 
   Safari National park has 10 fewer flamingos than giraffes. 
   So, Safari National park has 40 - 10 = 30 flamingos. 
   Savanna National park has 3 * 30 = 90 flamingos.

9. Hippos: Savanna National park has 5 more hippos than its crocodiles. 
   So, Savanna National park has 40 + 5 = 45 hippos.

Now, let's add the number of each type of animal in Savanna National park:
200 (lions) + 150 (snakes) + 60 (giraffes) + 100 (zebras) + 65 (elephants) + 90 (monkeys) + 40 (crocodiles) + 90 (flamingos) + 45 (hippos) = 740

1. Goats: 3 goats for $400 each = 3 * $400 = $1200
2. Llamas: Twice as many as goats, so 6 llamas. Each llama costs 50% more than a goat, so $400 + ($400 * 0.5) = $600 per llama. Total cost for llamas = 6 * $600 = $3600
3. Alpacas: 4 alpacas that cost 25% less than a llama, so $600 - ($600 * 0.25) = $450 per alpaca. Total cost for alpacas = 4 * $450 = $1800
4. Zebras: 2 zebras that cost twice as much as a goat, so $400 * 2 = $800 per zebra. Total cost for zebras = 2 * $800 = $1600
5. Ponies: As many ponies as goats, so 3 ponies. Each pony costs $100 more than a goat, so $400 + $100 = $500 per pony. Total cost for ponies = 3 * $500 = $1500
6. Peacocks: 5 peacocks that cost 50% less than a pony, so $500 - ($500 * 0.5) = $250 per peacock. Total cost for peacocks = 5 * $250 = $1250
7. Kangaroos: 3 kangaroos that cost 20% more than a zebra, so $800 + ($800 * 0.2) = $960 per kangaroo. Total cost for kangaroos = 3 * $960 = $2880
8. Rabbits: 8 rabbits for $75 each = 8 * $75 = $600

Now, let's add the total cost of all the animals:

Each sector has 10 men and 10 women, so there are 10 * 8 = 80 men and 80 women in total. However, we are given that there are 160 employees in total, which means each sector has 10 men and 10 women, and there are 8 sectors in total.

The cost for each color of t-shirts is:
- White: (10 * 8) * ($20 + $15) = 80 * $35 = $2800

1. Billy has 10 fish.
2. Nina has 2 fewer fish than Billy, so Nina has 10 - 2 = 8 fish.
3. Tony has 3 times as many fish as Billy, so Tony has 3 * 10 = 30 fish.
4. Sarah has 5 more fish than Tony, so Sarah has 30 + 5 = 35 fish.
5. Bobby has twice as many fish as Sarah, so Bobby has 2 * 35 = 70 fish.
6. Omar has half as many fish as Bobby, so Omar has 70 / 2 = 35 fish.
7. Priya has 4 times as many fish as Nina, so Priya has 4 * 8 = 32 fish.
8. Chen has 10 more fish than Sarah, so Chen has 35 + 10 = 45 fish.
9. Luis has as many fish as Tony and Billy combined, so Luis has 30 + 10 = 40 fish.
10. Ava has 3 fewer fish than Omar, so Ava has 35 - 3 = 32 fish.

Now, let's add up the total number of fish:
10 (Billy) + 8 (Nina) + 30 (Tony) + 35 (Sarah) + 70 (Bobby) + 35 (Omar) + 32 (Priya) + 45 (Chen) + 40 (Luis) + 32 (Ava) = 297

Spiders have 8 legs each. Monroe has 8 spiders, so the total number of spider legs is 8 * 8 = 64.

Ants have 6 legs each. Monroe has 12 ants, so the total number of ant legs is 6 * 12 = 72.

Beetles have 6 legs each. Monroe has 5 beetles, so the total number of beetle legs is 6 * 5 = 30.

Scorpions have 8 legs each. Monroe has 3 scorpions, so the total number of scorpion legs is 8 * 3 = 24.

Crickets have 6 legs each. Monroe has 10 crickets, so the total number of cricket legs is 6 * 10 = 60.

Crabs have 10 legs each. Monroe has 2 crabs, so the total number of crab legs is 10 * 2 = 20.

Ladybugs have 6 legs each. Monroe has 7 ladybugs, so the total number of ladybug legs is 6 * 7 = 42.

Tarantulas have 8 legs each. Monroe has 4 tarantulas, so the total number of tarantula legs is 8 * 4 = 32.
