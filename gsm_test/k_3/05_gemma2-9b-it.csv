1. **Bob:** Bob has 3 times as many sheep as David, who has 20. So Bob has 3 * 20 = 60 sheep.

2. **Alice:** Alice has 5 times as many sheep as Bob, who has 60. So Alice has 5 * 60 = 300 sheep.

3. **Seattle:** Seattle has 2 times as many sheep as Alice, who has 300. So Seattle has 2 * 300 = 600 sheep.

4. **Charleston:** Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, who has 600. So Charleston has 4 * 600 = 2400 sheep.

5. **Toulouse:** Toulouse has 2 times as many sheep as Charleston, who has 2400. So Toulouse has 2 * 2400 = 4800 sheep.

* Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats, so if Wanda brings 90 treats, Jane brings 0.75 * 90 = 67.5 treats.
* Jane brings 67.5 treats * 75% = 50.625 pieces of bread.

**2. Calculate Wanda's items:**

* Wanda brings 90 treats.

He also buys 4 alpacas that cost 25% less each than a llama. He buys 2 zebras that cost twice as much as a goat each. He buys as many ponies as goats, and each pony costs $100 more than a goat. How much did he spend?",9700.0,"Here's how to break down the problem step-by-step:

**1. Goats:**

* Cost of one goat: $400
* Cost of three goats: 3 * $400 = $1200

**2. Llamas:**

* Number of llamas: 3 goats * 2 = 6 llamas
* Cost of one llama: $400 * 1.50 (50% more) = $600
* Cost of six llamas: 6 * $600 = $3600

**3. Alpacas:**

* Cost of one alpaca: $600 * 0.75 (25% less) = $450
* Cost of four alpacas: 4 * $450 = $1800

**4. Zebras:**

* Cost of one zebra: $400 * 2 = $800
* Cost of two zebras: 2 * $800 = $1600

**5. Ponies:**

* Number of ponies: 3 goats = 3 ponies
* Cost of one pony: $400 + $100 = $500
* Cost of three ponies: 3 * $500 = $1500

**6. Total Cost:**

* Total spent: $1200 + $3600 + $1800 + $1600 + $1500 = $9700

Next, Zelda the zany zebra stands on her back legs for 4 minutes more than Pulsar. After that, Trixie the tiny tiger stands on her back legs for twice as long as Petra. What is the combined length of time, in minutes, that all the entertainers mentioned stand on their back legs?",84.0,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Polly's time:** Polly stands on her back legs for three times as long as Pulsar, who stands for 10 minutes. So Polly stands for 3 * 10 = 30 minutes.

2. **Petra's time:** Petra stands on her back legs for one-sixth as long as Polly, who stands for 30 minutes. So Petra stands for 30 / 6 = 5 minutes.

3. **Marvin's time:** Marvin stands on his back legs for half as long as Polly, who stands for 30 minutes. So Marvin stands for 30 / 2 = 15 minutes.

4. **Zelda's time:** Zelda stands on her back legs for 4 minutes more than Pulsar, who stands for 10 minutes. So Zelda stands for 10 + 4 = 14 minutes.

5. **Trixie's time:** Trixie stands on her back legs for twice as long as Petra, who stands for 5 minutes. So Trixie stands for 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.

6. **Total time:** Now, add up the time each entertainer stands on their back legs: 10 + 30 + 5 + 15 + 14 + 10 = 84 minutes.

Under the same conditions, sailing with one reefed sail brings her ship to the speed of 15 knots, and she sails for 4 hours with a reefed sail. what is the total distance, in land miles, that she will travel?",644.0,"Here's how to break down the problem to find the solution:

**1. Calculate the distance traveled with one sail:**

* Speed with one sail: 25 knots
* Time with one sail: 4 hours
* Distance with one sail: 25 knots * 4 hours = 100 nautical miles

**2. Calculate the distance traveled with two sails:**

* Speed with two sails: 50 knots
* Time with two sails: 4 hours
* Distance with two sails: 50 knots * 4 hours = 200 nautical miles

**3. Calculate the distance traveled with three sails:**

* Speed with three sails: 60 knots
* Time with three sails: 1 hour
* Distance with three sails: 60 knots * 1 hour = 60 nautical miles

**4. Calculate the distance traveled with four sails:**

* Speed with four sails: 70 knots
* Time with four sails: 2 hours
* Distance with four sails: 70 knots * 2 hours = 140 nautical miles

**5. Calculate the distance traveled with a reefed sail:**

* Speed with a reefed sail: 15 knots
* Time with a reefed sail: 4 hours
* Distance with a reefed sail: 15 knots * 4 hours = 60 nautical miles

**6. Calculate the total distance in nautical miles:**

* Total distance: 100 nautical miles + 200 nautical miles + 60 nautical miles + 140 nautical miles + 60 nautical miles = 560 nautical miles

**7. Convert the total distance to land miles:**

* Total distance in land miles: 560 nautical miles * 1.15 land miles/nautical mile = 644 land miles
