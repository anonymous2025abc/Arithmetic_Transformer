**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rain collected.**

- Monday: 4 inches
- Tuesday: 3 inches
- Wednesday: 2 inches
- Thursday: 1 inch
- Friday: 5 inches

Total inches of rain = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 5 = 15 inches

3. **Blue Candies:**
   - Let \( B \) be the number of blue candies.
   - According to the problem, there are half as many blue candies as yellow candies.

4. **Green Candies:**
   - Let \( G \) be the number of green candies.
   - According to the problem, there are half as many green candies as red candies.
   - Therefore, \( G = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \).

5. **Purple Candies:**
   - Let \( P \) be the number of purple candies.
   - According to the problem, there are 10 less than five times as many purple candies as yellow candies.
   - Therefore, \( P = 5 \times 100 - 10 = 500 - 10 = 490 \).

6. **Orange Candies:**
   - Let \( O \) be the number of orange candies.

1. **House 1**: 12 carpets
2. **House 2**: 20 carpets
3. **House 3**: 10 carpets
4. **House 4**: Twice as many carpets as house 3
   - \(2 \times 10 = 20\) carpets
5. **House 5**: 8 carpets

There were also twice as many zebras as leopards. There were also 3 fewer giraffes than zebras. There were also half as many buffaloes as antelopes and rabbits combined. What is the total number of animals that Josie counted?",927.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Counting Antelopes:**
   - Number of antelopes = \(80\).

2. **Counting Rabbits:**
   - Number of rabbits = Number of antelopes + 34 = \(80 + 34 = 114\).

3. **Counting Hyenas:**
   - Total number of antelopes and rabbits = \(80 + 114 = 194\).
   - Number of hyenas = Total number of antelopes and rabbits - 42 = \(194 - 42 = 152\).

4. **Counting Wild Dogs:**
   - Number of wild dogs = Number of hyenas + 50 = \(152 + 50 = 202\).

5. **Counting Leopards:**
   - Number of leopards = \(\frac{1}{2} \times\) Number of rabbits = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 114 = 57\).

6. **Counting Zebras:**
   - Number of zebras = \(2 \times\) Number of leopards = \(2 \times 57 = 114\).

7. **Counting Giraffes:**
   - Number of giraffes = Number of zebras - 3 = \(114 - 3 = 111\).

8. **Counting Buffaloes:**
   - Total number of antelopes and rabbits = \(194\).
   - Number of buffaloes = \(\frac{1}{2} \times\) Total number of antelopes and rabbits = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 194 = 97\).

Now, let's sum up all the animals:

- Antelopes: \(80\)

- Let \( R_M \) be the number of red marbles Mary collected.
- Let \( B_M \) be the number of blue marbles Mary collected.

- Let \( B_L \) be the number of blue marbles Leo collected.

Given:
\[ R_J = 30 \]
\[ B_J = 25 \]

From the problem statement, we can derive the following relationships:

1. Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny:
\[ R_M = 2R_J = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

2. Mary collected half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie:
\[ B_M = \frac{1}{2}B_A \]

3. Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary:
\[ R_A = R_M + 20 = 60 + 20 = 80 \]

4. Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected:
\[ B_A = 2B_J = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

5. Tom collected three times as many red marbles as Mary:
\[ R_T = 3R_M = 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

6. Tom collected 5 fewer blue marbles than Jenny:
\[ B_T = B_J - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \]

7. Sara collected 10 fewer red marbles than Anie:
\[ R_S = R_A - 10 = 80 - 10 = 70 \]

8. Sara collected five times as many blue marbles as Mary:
\[ B_S = 5B_M = 5 \times B_M \]
Since \( B_M = \frac{1}{2}B_A \):
\[ B_S = 5 \times \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 5 \times 25 = 125 \]

9. Leo collected three times as many red marbles as Jenny:
\[ R_L = 3R_J = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

10. Leo collected three times as many blue marbles as Jenny:
\[ B_L = 3B_J = 3 \times 25 = 75 \]

4. **Thursday**: Natalia rode 65 kilometers.
5. **Friday**: Natalia rode 30 kilometers.
6. **Saturday**: Natalia rode 50% fewer kilometers than Thursday. 
   - 50% of 65 kilometers is \( \frac{50}{100} \times 65 = 32.5 \) kilometers.
   - Therefore, 50% fewer kilometers than Thursday is \( 65 - 32.5 = 32.5 \) kilometers.
7. **Sunday**: Natalia rode as many kilometers as the sum of the kilometers from Monday and Saturday.

- Let \( T_O \) be the number of treats Omar brings.
- Let \( B_O \) be the number of pieces of bread Omar brings.

From the problem, we know:
1. Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats: \( B_J = 0.75T_J \).
2. Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane: \( T_W = \frac{1}{2}T_J \).
3. Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats: \( B_W = 3T_W \).
4. Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane: \( T_C = \frac{1}{3}T_J \).
5. Carlos brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats: \( B_C = 2T_C \).
6. Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda: \( T_M = T_W - 10 \).
7. Mia brings half as many pieces of bread as treats: \( B_M = 0.5T_M \).
8. Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda: \( T_O = 1.5T_W \).
9. Omar brings four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats: \( B_O = \frac{4}{5}T_O \).

We are also given that Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread: \( B_W = 90 \).

Using the relationship for Wanda's bread and treats:
\[ B_W = 3T_W \]
\[ 90 = 3T_W \]
\[ T_W = 30 \]

Now, using the value of \( T_W \):
\[ T_J = 2T_W = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]
\[ B_J = 0.75T_J = 0.75 \times 60 = 45 \]
\[ T_C = \frac{1}{3}T_J = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \]
\[ B_C = 2T_C = 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
\[ T_M = T_W - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]

1. **Calculate the total number of legs Borgnine has already seen:**
   - Chimps: Each chimp has 2 legs. So, \(12 \text{ chimps} \times 2 \text{ legs/chimp} = 24 \text{ legs}\).
   - Lions: Each lion has 4 legs. So, \(8 \text{ lions} \times 4 \text{ legs/lion} = 32 \text{ legs}\).
   - Lizards: Each lizard has 4 legs. So, \(5 \text{ lizards} \times 4 \text{ legs/lizard} = 20 \text{ legs}\).
   - Penguins: Each penguin has 2 legs. So, \(8 \text{ penguins} \times 2 \text{ legs/penguin} = 16 \text{ legs}\).
   - Elephants: Each elephant has 4 legs. So, \(6 \text{ elephants} \times 4 \text{ legs/elephant} = 24 \text{ legs}\).
   - Parrots: Each parrot has 2 legs. So, \(12 \text{ parrots} \times 2 \text{ legs/parrot} = 24 \text{ legs}\).

2. **Sum up all the legs seen so far:**
   \[
   24 \text{ (chimps)} + 32 \text{ (lions)} + 20 \text{ (lizards)} + 16 \text{ (penguins)} + 24 \text{ (elephants)} + 24 \text{ (parrots)} = 136 \text{ legs}

There is also an annual maintenance fee of $600 per person. Each person also pays $50 per month for gym access. The family buys 2 guest passes each month at $30 each. John agrees to pay half the total cost for the whole family. How much does John pay for the first year?,34760.0,"Let's break down the costs and calculate the total amount John needs to pay for the first year.

1. **Joining Fee:**
   - There are 4 people (John + 3 family members).
   - Joining fee per person = $4000.
   - Total joining fee = \(4 \times 4000 = 16000\).

2. **Monthly Cost:**
   - Monthly cost per person = $1000.
   - For 12 months, the total monthly cost for 4 people = \(4 \times 1000 \times 12 = 48000\).

3. **Annual Maintenance Fee:**
   - Annual maintenance fee per person = $600.
   - Total annual maintenance fee for 4 people = \(4 \times 600 = 2400\).

4. **Gym Access Fee:**
   - Gym access fee per person per month = $50.
   - For 12 months, the total gym access fee for 4 people = \(4 \times 50 \times 12 = 2400\).

5. **Guest Passes:**
   - Guest passes cost $30 each, and they buy 2 guest passes each month.
   - Total cost for guest passes per month = \(2 \times 30 = 60\).
   - For 12 months, the total cost for guest passes for 4 people = \(4 \times 60 \times 12 = 2880\).

Now, let's sum up all these costs:

- Total joining fee: \(16000\)
- Total monthly cost: \(48000\)
- Total annual maintenance fee: \(2400\)
- Total gym access fee: \(2400\)
- Total guest pass cost: \(2880\)

Total cost for the family for one year:
\[ 16000 + 48000 + 2400 + 2400 + 2880 = 61680 \]

2. **Aaron**: 0 pieces (only eats garlic bread and salad)
3. **Kai**: 2 pieces (twice as much as Manny)

- Kai: 2 pieces
- Raphael: 0.5 piece

First, add the whole numbers:

\[ 1 + 2 + 2.5 + 2 + 3 = 10.5 \]

Next, add the fractions:

\[ 0.5 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \]

\[ 10.5 + \frac{5}{6} \]

Convert 10.5 to a fraction with a common denominator of 6:

\[ 10.5 = \frac{63}{6} \]

So,

\[ \frac{63}{6} + \frac{5}{6} = \frac{68}{6} = \frac{34}{3} \approx 11.33 \]

Since we need to cut the lasagna into whole pieces, we round up to the nearest whole number because even a small fraction of a piece means an additional slice is needed.

5. **Avery's Stuffed Animals:**
   - Avery has half as many stuffed animals as Kenley.
   - \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \)
   - So, Avery has 34 stuffed animals.

6. **Jordan's Stuffed Animals:**
   - Jordan has 3 times as many stuffed animals as McKenna.
   - \( 3 \times 34 = 102 \)
   - So, Jordan has 102 stuffed animals.

Now, let's sum up all the stuffed animals:

\[
34 + 68 + 73 + 63 + 34 + 102
\]

First, add the numbers in pairs for simplicity:

\[
34 + 68 = 102
\]
\[
73 + 63 = 136
\]
\[
34 + 102 = 136
\]

Now, add these results together:

\[
102 + 136 + 136 = 374
\]

So, the total number of stuffed animals is:

Her friends are Jessica, Tori, Lily, Patrice, Ava, Monique, and Ben. If each jelly bracelet costs $2, what is the total she will spend in dollars?",70.0,"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of letters in each friend's first name:**
   - Jessica: 7 letters
   - Tori: 4 letters
   - Lily: 4 letters
   - Patrice: 7 letters
   - Ava: 3 letters
   - Monique: 7 letters
   - Ben: 3 letters

2. **Sum the total number of letters:**
   \[
   7 + 4 + 4 + 7 + 3 + 7 + 3 = 35

8,qwen-7B,Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct,3,49,48,Monroe has a collection of ants and a collection of spiders. He has 8 spiders and 12 ants. He also has 5 beetles. He also has 3 scorpions. He also has 10 crickets. What is the total number of legs in his entire collection?,250.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs contributed by each type of insect in Monroe's collection and then sum these totals.

1. **Spiders:**
   - Spiders have 8 legs each.
   - Monroe has 8 spiders.
   - Total legs from spiders = \(8 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs/spider} = 64 \text{ legs}\).

2. **Ants:**
   - Ants have 6 legs each.
   - Monroe has 12 ants.
   - Total legs from ants = \(12 \text{ ants} \times 6 \text{ legs/ant} = 72 \text{ legs}\).

3. **Beetles:**
   - Beetles have 6 legs each.
   - Monroe has 5 beetles.
   - Total legs from beetles = \(5 \text{ beetles} \times 6 \text{ legs/beetle} = 30 \text{ legs}\).

4. **Scorpions:**
   - Scorpions have 8 legs each.
   - Monroe has 3 scorpions.
   - Total legs from scorpions = \(3 \text{ scorpions} \times 8 \text{ legs/scorpion} = 24 \text{ legs}\).

5. **Crickets:**
   - Crickets have 6 legs each.
   - Monroe has 10 crickets.
   - Total legs from crickets = \(10 \text{ crickets} \times 6 \text{ legs/cricket} = 60 \text{ legs}\).

Now, we sum all the legs from each type of insect:

\[
64 \text{ (spiders)} + 72 \text{ (ants)} + 30 \text{ (beetles)} + 24 \text{ (scorpions)} + 60 \text{ (crickets)} = 250 \text{ legs}

For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs. The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs. The machine has twice as many orange gumballs as blue gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",93.0,"Let's start by defining the number of each type of gumball based on the given information.

1. **Red Gumballs (R):**
   - Given: \( R = 16 \)

2. **Blue Gumballs (B):**
   - The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs.
   - Therefore, \( B = \frac{R}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \)

3. **Green Gumballs (G):**
   - For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs.
   - Therefore, \( G = 4B = 4 \times 8 = 32 \)

4. **Yellow Gumballs (Y):**
   - The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs.
   - Therefore, \( Y = B = 8 \)

5. **Purple Gumballs (P):**
   - The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs.
   - Therefore, \( P = R - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \)

6. **Orange Gumballs (O):**
   - The machine has twice as many orange gumballs as blue gumballs.
   - Therefore, \( O = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \)

Now, we sum up all the gumballs to find the total number of gumballs in the machine:

\[
\text{Total} = R + B + G + Y + P + O
\]

Substituting the values we found:

\[
\text{Total} = 16 + 8 + 32 + 8 + 13 + 16
\]

Adding these together:

\[
\text{Total} = 16 + 8 = 24
\]
\[
\text{Total} = 24 + 32 = 56
\]
\[
\text{Total} = 56 + 8 = 64
\]
\[
\text{Total} = 64 + 13 = 77
\]
\[
\text{Total} = 77 + 16 = 93
