If Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, how many candies remained?",620.0," Let's break down the problem:

1. There were 40 red candies.
2. There were 20 less than three times as many yellow candies as red candies. So, the number of yellow candies is 3*40 - 20 = 120 - 20 = 100.
3. There were half as many blue candies as yellow candies. So, the number of blue candies is 100/2 = 50.
4. There were also half as many green candies as red candies. So, the number of green candies is 40/2 = 20.
5. There were also 10 less than five times as many purple candies as yellow candies. So, the number of purple candies is 5*100 - 10 = 500 - 10 = 490.
6. There were also one-fifth as many orange candies as yellow candies. So, the number of orange candies is 100/5 = 20.

The bedroom walls take up 400 square feet each, and there are 3 of them, so the total square footage of the bedroom walls is 400 * 3 = 1200 square feet.

The kitchen walls take up 500 square feet each, and there are 6 of them, so the total square footage of the kitchen walls is 500 * 6 = 3000 square feet.

The dining room walls take up 240 square feet each, and there are 5 of them, so the total square footage of the dining room walls is 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

Since one gallon of paint covers 600 square feet, Henrietta will need 7600 / 600 = 12.67 gallons of paint.

Since she can't buy a fraction of a gallon, she will need to buy 13 gallons of paint.

- Chopping peppers: It takes him 3 minutes to chop a pepper, and he needs to chop 4 peppers. So, he spends 3 minutes/pepper * 4 peppers = 12 minutes on chopping peppers.
- Chopping onions: It takes him 4 minutes to chop an onion, and he needs to chop 2 onions. So, he spends 4 minutes/onion * 2 onions = 8 minutes on chopping onions.
- Grating cheese: It takes him 1 minute to grate enough cheese for one omelet, and he needs to grate cheese for 5 omelets. So, he spends 1 minute/omelet * 5 omelets = 5 minutes on grating cheese.
- Assembling and cooking omelets: It takes him 5 minutes to assemble and cook one omelet, and he needs to cook 5 omelets. So, he spends 5 minutes/omelet * 5 omelets = 25 minutes on assembling and cooking omelets.
- Chopping tomatoes: It takes him 4 minutes to chop a tomato, and he needs to chop 3 tomatoes. So, he spends 4 minutes/tomato * 3 tomatoes = 12 minutes on chopping tomatoes.
- Slicing mushrooms: It takes him 2 minutes to slice enough mushrooms for one omelet, and he adds mushrooms to each of the 5 omelets. So, he spends 2 minutes/omelet * 5 omelets = 10 minutes on slicing mushrooms.
- Dicing ham: It takes him 3 minutes to dice enough ham for one omelet, and he adds ham to each of the 5 omelets. So, he spends 3 minutes/omelet * 5 omelets = 15 minutes on dicing ham.

How many 10 oz servings of punch does Carrie have?",23.0," First, let's calculate the total volume of each type of drink that Carrie adds to the punch.

For the Mountain Dew, she adds 6 cans, each of 12 oz. So, the total volume of Mountain Dew is 6 * 12 = 72 oz.

For the ginger ale, she adds 5 cans, each of 8 oz. So, the total volume of ginger ale is 5 * 8 = 40 oz.

For the orange soda, she adds 2 bottles, each of 15 oz. So, the total volume of orange soda is 2 * 15 = 30 oz.

Now, let's add up the total volume of all the drinks that Carrie adds to the punch. The total volume is 72 oz (Mountain Dew) + 28 oz (ice) + 40 oz (fruit juice) + 40 oz (ginger ale) + 30 oz (orange soda) + 20 oz (cranberry juice) = 210 oz.

Finally, to find out how many 10 oz servings of punch Carrie has, we divide the total volume by the volume of each serving. So, the number of servings is 210 oz / 10 oz/serving = 21 servings.

Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane and three times as many pieces of bread as treats. Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane and twice as many pieces of bread as treats. Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda and half as many pieces of bread as treats. Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda and four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats. If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",396.0," Let's denote the number of treats that Jane brings as J, the number of pieces of bread that Jane brings as B, the number of treats that Wanda brings as W, the number of pieces of bread that Wanda brings as BW, the number of treats that Carlos brings as C, the number of pieces of bread that Carlos brings as BC, the number of treats that Mia brings as M, the number of pieces of bread that Mia brings as BM, the number of treats that Omar brings as O, and the number of pieces of bread that Omar brings as BO.

From the problem, we know that:

1. B = 0.75J
2. W = 0.5J
3. BW = 3W
4. C = 0.33J
5. BC = 2C
6. M = W - 10
7. BM = 0.5M
8. O = 1.5W
9. BO = 0.8O

We also know that Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, so BW = 90.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. From equation 3, we can find the number of treats that Jane brings: W = 0.5J, so 90 = 0.5J, which gives J = 90 / 0.5 = 180.
2. From equation 1, we can find the number of pieces of bread that Jane brings: B = 0.75J, so B = 0.75 * 180 = 135.
3. From equation 2, we can find the number of treats that Wanda brings: W = 0.5J, so W = 0.5 * 180 = 90.
4. From equation 3, we can find the number of pieces of bread that Wanda brings: BW = 3W, so BW = 3 * 90 = 270.
5. From equation 4, we can find the number of treats that Carlos brings: C = 0.33J, so C = 0.33 * 180 = 59.4, which we can round to 59 since we can't have a fraction of a treat.
6. From equation 5, we can find the number of pieces of bread that Carlos brings: BC = 2C, so BC = 2 * 59 = 118.
7. From equation 6, we can find the number of treats that Mia brings: M = W - 10, so M = 90 - 10 = 80.
8. From equation 7, we can find the number of pieces of bread that Mia brings: BM = 0.5M, so BM = 0.5 * 80 = 40.
9. From equation 8, we can find the number of treats that Omar brings: O = 1.5W, so O = 1.5 * 90 = 135.
10. From equation 9, we can find the number of pieces of bread that Omar brings: BO = 0.8O, so BO = 0.8 * 135 = 108.

Now, let's add up all the treats and pieces of bread that everyone brought:

Total treats = J + W + C + M + O = 180 + 90 + 59 + 80 + 135 = 544.
Total pieces of bread = B + BW + BC + BM + BO = 135 + 270 + 118 + 40 + 108 = 771.

So, the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo is 544 + 771 = 1315.

Under the same conditions, sailing with one reefed sail brings her ship to the speed of 15 knots, and she sails for 4 hours with a reefed sail. what is the total distance, in land miles, that she will travel?",644.0," First, we need to convert the speed of the sailboat from knots to land miles per hour. 

1 knot = 1.15 land miles per hour.

So, the speed of the sailboat with one sail is 25 knots * 1.15 = 28.75 land miles per hour.
The speed of the sailboat with two sails is 50 knots * 1.15 = 57.5 land miles per hour.
The speed of the sailboat with three sails is 60 knots * 1.15 = 69 land miles per hour.
The speed of the sailboat with four sails is 70 knots * 1.15 = 79.5 land miles per hour.
The speed of the sailboat with one reefed sail is 15 knots * 1.15 = 17.25 land miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance traveled for each part of the journey.

For the first part of the journey, Buffy sails for 4 hours with one sail at a speed of 28.75 land miles per hour. So, the distance traveled is 4 hours * 28.75 land miles per hour = 115 land miles.

For the second part of the journey, Buffy sails for 4 hours with two sails at a speed of 57.5 land miles per hour. So, the distance traveled is 4 hours * 57.5 land miles per hour = 230 land miles.

For the third part of the journey, Buffy sails for 1 hour with three sails at a speed of 69 land miles per hour. So, the distance traveled is 1 hour * 69 land miles per hour = 69 land miles.

For the fourth part of the journey, Buffy sails for 2 hours with four sails at a speed of 79.5 land miles per hour. So, the distance traveled is 2 hours * 79.5 land miles per hour = 159 land miles.

For the fifth part of the journey, Buffy sails for 4 hours with one reefed sail at a speed of 17.25 land miles per hour. So, the distance traveled is 4 hours * 17.25 land miles per hour = 69 land miles.

Finally, we add up all the distances to find the total distance traveled.

8. Tina will eat 3 pieces.

Now, let's calculate how much lasagna each person will eat:

1. Manny eats 1 piece.
2. Aaron eats 0 pieces.
3. Kai eats twice as much as Manny, so he eats 2 * 1 = 2 pieces.
4. Raphael eats half the amount Manny does, so he eats 0.5 * 1 = 0.5 pieces. Since we can't have half a piece, we'll round up to 1 piece.
5. Lisa eats two pieces, plus any leftovers from Raphael's piece. Since Raphael eats 1 piece, Lisa eats 2 + 1 = 3 pieces.
6. Nora eats one-third of what Manny eats, so she eats 1/3 * 1 = 0.33 pieces. Since we can't have a fraction of a piece, we'll round up to 1 piece. Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves, so she will eat 1 piece.
7. Ben eats the same amount of lasagna as Kai, so he eats 2 pieces.
8. Tina eats 3 pieces.

Now, let's add up all the pieces:

1 (Manny) + 0 (Aaron) + 2 (Kai) + 1 (Raphael) + 3 (Lisa) + 1 (Nora) + 2 (Ben) + 3 (Tina) = 14 pieces
