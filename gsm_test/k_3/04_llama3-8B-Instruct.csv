Under the same conditions, sailing with one reefed sail brings her ship to the speed of 15 knots, and she sails for 4 hours with a reefed sail. what is the total distance, in land miles, that she will travel?",644.0,"First, we need to find the distance traveled in nautical miles. 

With one sail, she travels for 4 hours at 25 knots. So she travels 4 * 25 = 100 nautical miles.

With two sails, she travels for 4 hours at 50 knots. So she travels 4 * 50 = 200 nautical miles.

With three sails, she travels for 1 hour at 60 knots. So she travels 1 * 60 = 60 nautical miles.

With four sails, she travels for 2 hours at 70 knots. So she travels 2 * 70 = 140 nautical miles.

With a reefed sail, she travels for 4 hours at 15 knots. So she travels 4 * 15 = 60 nautical miles.

Now we need to convert the nautical miles to land miles. We know that 1 nautical mile is 1.15 land miles. So we multiply the nautical miles by 1.15 to get the land miles.

100 nautical miles * 1.15 = 115 land miles

200 nautical miles * 1.15 = 230 land miles

60 nautical miles * 1.15 = 69 land miles

140 nautical miles * 1.15 = 161 land miles

60 nautical miles * 1.15 = 69 land miles

Now we add up the total distance traveled in land miles:

115 + 230 + 69 + 161 + 69 = 684
