How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle, Alice, Bob and David have together if David has 20 sheep?",8180.0," Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Toulouse has 2 times as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 x 4 = 8 sheep more than Charleston.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 x 2 = 8 sheep more than Seattle.
3. Seattle has 2 times as many sheep as Alice, so Seattle has 2 x 5 = 10 sheep more than Alice.
4. Alice has 5 times as many sheep as Bob, so Alice has 5 x 3 = 15 sheep more than Bob.
5. Bob has 3 times as many sheep as David, so Bob has 3 x 20 = 60 sheep more than David.

How old is the youngest brother?,28.0," To solve this problem, we can use the information given to us to create a system of linear equations. Let's assume the ages of the three oldest brothers are x, x + 1, and x + 2, respectively. Since their sum is 96, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 96

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3x + 3 = 96

Now, we are given that Liam is 1 year younger than the youngest of the three oldest brothers. So, the age of Liam is x - 1.

We are also given that Noah is 1 year younger than Liam, so the age of Noah is (x - 1) - 1 = x - 2.

Finally, we are given that Owen is 1 year younger than Noah, so the age of Owen is (x - 2) - 1 = x - 3.

Now, we can substitute these values into the equation 3x + 3 = 96 to find the value of x:

3(x - 3) + 3 = 96

Ivy takes 5 hours less than Fernando to run all around the two arenas. what's the total time it takes everyone mentioned to run all around the two arenas?",145.0," Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Emma can run all around two arenas in 20 hours.
* Fernando takes twice as long as Emma to run his course, so it takes him 40 hours (2 x 20 = 40).
* Gina takes half as long as Fernando to run all around the two arenas, so it takes her 20 hours (1/2 x 40 = 20).
* Harold takes 10 hours more than Emma to run all around the two arenas, so it takes him 30 hours (10 + 20 = 30).
* Ivy takes 5 hours less than Fernando to run all around the two arenas, so it takes her 15 hours (5 - 40 = -15).

Now, let's add up the total time it takes everyone to run all around the two arenas:

Emma: 20 hours
Fernando: 40 hours
Gina: 20 hours
Harold: 30 hours
Ivy: -15 hours (since she takes less time than Fernando, she actually runs the course in -15 hours)

If his farm produced 400 kg of mangoes and he sold the fruits at $50 per kg, calculate the total amount of money he got in that season.",145000.0," To solve this problem, we need to gather information and use mathematical formulas to calculate the total amount of money Mr. Sergio got in that season.

Let's start by using the information given in the problem:

1. The total produce of apples was twice the total produce of mangoes. So, if the total produce of apples was 400 kg, the total produce of mangoes was 200 kg.
2. The total produce of oranges was 200 kg more than that of mangoes. So, the total produce of oranges was 600 kg (200 kg + 200 kg).
3. He produced 100 kg fewer bananas than apples. So, the total produce of bananas was 300 kg (400 kg - 100 kg).
4. The total produce of peaches was half the total produce of oranges. So, the total produce of peaches was 300 kg (600 kg / 2 = 300 kg).
5. He harvested one-fourth as many guavas as mangoes. So, the total produce of guavas was 200 kg (400 kg / 4 = 200 kg).

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Mr. Sergio got in that season:

1. The price of apples was $50 per kg. So, the total amount of money he got from apples was $50 x 400 kg = $20,000.
2. The price of mangoes was $50 per kg. So, the total amount of money he got from mangoes was $50 x 200 kg = $10,000.
3. The price of oranges was $40 per kg. So, the total amount of money he got from oranges was $40 x 600 kg = $24,000.
4. The price of bananas was $30 per kg. So, the total amount of money he got from bananas was $30 x 300 kg = $9,000.
5. The price of peaches was $35 per kg. So, the total amount of money he got from peaches was $35 x 300 kg = $10,500.
6. The price of guavas was $45 per kg. So, the total amount of money he got from guavas was $45 x 200 kg = $9,000.

Adding up the total amount of money he got from each fruit, we get:

$20,000 + $10,000 + $24,000 + $9,000 + $10,500 + $9,000 = $72,500

How much does John pay for the first year?,34760.0," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for the whole family for the first year, and then determine John's share of that cost.

1. Calculate the total cost for the whole family for the first year:

Family size = 4 (John and 3 other family members)

Total cost for the first year = $4000 x 4 = $16,000 (joining fee) + $1000 x 4 = $40,000 (monthly cost) + $600 x 4 = $24,000 (annual maintenance fee) + $50 x 12 = $600 (gym access) + $30 x 2 = $60 (guest passes) = $80,600

2. Determine John's share of the cost for the first year:

Since John agrees to pay half the total cost for the whole family, his share of the cost for the first year is:

John's share = $80,600 x 0.5 = $40,300

Therefore, John pays $40,300 for the first year.

Under the same conditions, sailing with one reefed sail brings her ship to the speed of 15 knots, and she sails for 4 hours with a reefed sail. what is the total distance, in land miles, that she will travel?",644.0," To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the problem to find the speeds of the sailboat under different conditions, and then use the formula for distance traveled to find the total distance.

1. Under optimal wind conditions, the use of two sails brings the ship to the speed of 50 knots, and the use of one sail brings the ship to the speed of 25 knots.
2. If she travels for 4 hours with one sail and then for another 4 hours with two sails, the total distance traveled can be found as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time

For 4 hours with one sail:
Distance = 25 knots x 4 hours = 100 nautical miles

For 4 hours with two sails:
Distance = 50 knots x 4 hours = 200 nautical miles

Total distance = 100 nautical miles + 200 nautical miles = 300 nautical miles

3. Under the same conditions, the use of three sails brings the ship to the speed of 60 knots, and she sails for 1 hour using three sails.
4. Under the same conditions, the use of four sails brings the ship to the speed of 70 knots, and she sails for 2 hours using four sails.
5. Sailing with one reefed sail brings her ship to the speed of 15 knots, and she sails for 4 hours with a reefed sail.

To find the total distance traveled under these conditions, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

For 1 hour with three sails:
Distance = 60 knots x 1 hour = 60 nautical miles

For 2 hours with four sails:
Distance = 70 knots x 2 hours = 140 nautical miles

For 4 hours with a reefed sail:
Distance = 15 knots x 4 hours = 60 nautical miles

Total distance = 60 nautical miles + 140 nautical miles + 60 nautical miles = 260 nautical miles

How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",12.0," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of lasagna that each person will eat, taking into account their individual preferences and the number of pieces that Lisa will eat.

1. Aaron - Does not like lasagna, will only eat garlic bread and salad, so no lasagna pieces for him.
2. Kai - Is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny, so Kai will eat 2 \* 2 = 4 pieces of lasagna.
3. Raphael - Will eat half the amount Manny does, so Raphael will eat 1/2 \* 4 = 2 pieces of lasagna.
4. Lisa - Loves lasagna and will eat 2 pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece, so Lisa will eat 2 + (2 \* 1/3) = 5 pieces of lasagna.
5. Nora - Is picky and will only eat one-third of what Manny eats, so Nora will eat 1/3 \* 4 = 1 piece of lasagna.
6. Ben - Will eat the same amount of lasagna as Kai, so Ben will eat 4 pieces of lasagna.
7. Tina - Loves lasagna and will eat 3 pieces, so Tina will eat 3 pieces of lasagna.

Now, let's calculate the total number of lasagna pieces that Manny should cut:

Total lasagna pieces eaten by everyone except Lisa = 4 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 3 = 19 pieces

Total lasagna pieces eaten by Lisa = 5 + (2 \* 1/3) = 8 pieces

Therefore, Manny should cut his lasagna into 19 + 8 = 27 pieces.

34 + 68 + 73 + 63 + 34 + 102 = 402

Therefore, all the people mentioned have a total of 402 stuffed animals.

The final answer is: #### 402",402,402.0,False,

Her friends are Jessica, Tori, Lily, Patrice, Ava, Monique, and Ben. If each jelly bracelet costs $2, what is the total she will spend in dollars?",70.0," To find the total cost that Robin will spend on jelly bracelets, we need to multiply the number of bracelets she wants to buy by the cost of each bracelet.

Since Robin wants to buy one bracelet for each letter of her friends' first names, we can use the number of letters in each name to determine how many bracelets she needs to buy. Here are the letters in each of Robin's friends' first names:

* Jessica: 7 letters
* Tori: 5 letters
* Lily: 5 letters
* Patrice: 9 letters
* Ava: 4 letters
* Monique: 9 letters
* Ben: 3 letters

So, the total number of bracelets Robin needs to buy is:

7 + 5 + 5 + 9 + 4 + 9 + 3 = 45

Since each bracelet costs $2, the total cost that Robin will spend on jelly bracelets is:

45 x $2 = $90

Therefore, the final answer is:

$90 <number>",90,90.0,False,

He also has 10 crickets. What is the total number of legs in his entire collection?,250.0," To find the total number of legs in Monroe's entire collection, we need to count the number of legs for each type of creature:

* Ants: 12
* Spiders: 8
* Beetles: 0 (beetles do not have legs)
* Scorpions: 8
* Crickets: 10

Therefore, the total number of legs in Monroe's entire collection is:

12 + 8 + 0 + 8 + 10 = 48

So, the final answer is: #### 48.",48.,48.0,False,

For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs. The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs. The machine has twice as many orange gumballs as blue gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",93.0," To solve this problem, we need to use the given information to find the number of each color of gumball in the machine.

1. The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs, so if the machine has 16 red gumballs, it has 8 blue gumballs.
2. For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs, so the machine has 32 green gumballs (4 x 8 = 32).
3. The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs, so the machine has 8 yellow gumballs.
4. The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs, so if the machine has 16 red gumballs, it has 13 purple gumballs.
5. The machine has twice as many orange gumballs as blue gumballs, so the machine has 16 orange gumballs (2 x 8 = 16).

So, the final answer is:

 #### 64
