If her final stage performance is 6 minutes long, what is the total combined amount of time, in minutes, that she spends practicing, throwing tantrums, singing, warm-up, costume changes and interviews in the final stage performance?",78.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time spent on each activity (practicing, throwing tantrums, singing, warm-up, costume changes, and interviews) based on the given information.

Let's denote the duration of the final stage performance as \( t \) minutes. According to the problem, \( t = 6 \) minutes.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Time Spent Singing:**
   - Carlotta sings for \( t \) minutes.
   - Given \( t = 6 \) minutes, she sings for 6 minutes.

2. **Time Spent Practicing:**
   - For every 1 minute of singing, she spends 3 minutes practicing.
   - Therefore, the time spent practicing is \( 3t \) minutes.
   - Substituting \( t = 6 \):
     \[
     3t = 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Time Spent Throwing Tantrums:**
   - For every 1 minute of singing, she spends 5 minutes throwing tantrums.
   - Therefore, the time spent throwing tantrums is \( 5t \) minutes.
   - Substituting \( t = 6 \):
     \[
     5t = 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Time Spent Warm-Up:**
   - For every 1 minute of singing, she spends 1 minute warming up.
   - Therefore, the time spent warming up is \( t \) minutes.
   - Substituting \( t = 6 \):
     \[
     t = 6 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Time Spent Costume Changes:**
   - For every 1 minute of singing, she spends 1 minute changing costumes.
   - Therefore, the time spent changing costumes is \( t \) minutes.
   - Substituting \( t = 6 \):
     \[
     t = 6 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Time Spent Interviews:**
   - For every 1 minute of singing, she spends 1 minute doing interviews.
   - Therefore, the time spent interviewing is \( t \) minutes.
   - Substituting \( t = 6 \):
     \[
     t = 6 \text{ minutes}
     \]

### Total Combined Time:

Now, we sum up all the times calculated above:
\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Singing} + \text{Practicing} + \text{Throwing Tantrums} + \text{Warm-Up} + \text{Costume Changes} + \text{Interviews}

If Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, how many candies remained?",620.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of each type of candy and then calculate the total remaining after Carlos eats all the yellow candies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Red Candies:**
   - Given: \( R = 40 \)

2. **Yellow Candies:**
   - Given: Yellow candies are 20 less than three times as many as red candies.
   - Let \( Y \) be the number of yellow candies.
   - Therefore, \( Y = 3R - 20 \).
   - Substituting \( R = 40 \):

3. **Blue Candies:**
   - Given: Blue candies are half as many as yellow candies.
   - Let \( B \) be the number of blue candies.
   - Therefore, \( B = \frac{Y}{2} \).
   - Substituting \( Y = 100 \):
     \[

     G = \frac{40}{2} = 20
     \]

5. **Purple Candies:**
   - Given: Purple candies are 10 less than five times as many as yellow candies.
   - Let \( P \) be the number of purple candies.
   - Therefore, \( P = 5Y - 10 \).
   - Substituting \( Y = 100 \):
     \[
     P = 5(100) - 10 = 500 - 10 = 490

6. **Orange Candies:**
   - Given: Orange candies are one-fifth as many as yellow candies.
   - Let \( O \) be the number of orange candies.
   - Therefore, \( O = \frac{Y}{5} \).
   - Substituting \( Y = 100 \):
     \[
     O = \frac{100}{5} = 20

&= 600 \text{ sq ft} + 1200 \text{ sq ft} + 3000 \text{ sq ft} + 1200 \text{ sq ft} + 1200 \text{ sq ft} \\
&= 7200 \text{ sq ft}
\end{align*}
\]

### Calculating Paint Needed:
Given that one gallon of paint covers 600 square feet, we need to find out how many gallons are required to cover 7200 square feet.

\[
\text{Gallons of paint needed} = \frac{\text{Total area}}{\text{Coverage per gallon}} = \frac{7200 \text{ sq ft}}{600 \text{ sq ft/gallon}} = 12 \text{ gallons}

He decides to eat some food so he orders fried chicken which costs $14. He also orders 2 nachos at $8.0 each. He also orders 1 wings (bucket) at $12.0 each. He also orders 7 bottle of wine at $25.0 each. He leaves a 30% tip on everything he orders. How much did he spend for the night?,426.9,"Let's break down the expenses and calculate them step by step.

### Step 1: Entrance Fee
James pays an entrance fee of $20.

### Step 2: Drinks for Friends
James buys 2 rounds for his 5 friends. Each round consists of 5 drinks (one for each friend).

\[ \text{Total drinks for friends} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \]
\[ \text{Cost of drinks for friends} = 10 \times \$6 = \$60 \]

### Step 3: Drinks for James
James buys 6 drinks for himself.

\[ \text{Cost of drinks for James} = 6 \times \$6 = \$36 \]

### Step 4: Food Expenses
James orders:
- Fried chicken for $14
- 2 nachos at $8 each
- 1 bucket of wings at $12
- 7 bottles of wine at $25 each

\[ \text{Cost of fried chicken} = \$14 \]
\[ \text{Cost of nachos} = 2 \times \$8 = \$16 \]
\[ \text{Cost of wings} = \$12 \]
\[ \text{Cost of wine} = 7 \times \$25 = \$175 \]

Adding these together:

\[ \text{Total food cost} = \$14 + \$16 + \$12 + \$175 = \$217 \]

### Step 5: Total Cost Before Tip
Now we add up all the expenses before the tip:

\[ \text{Total cost before tip} = \$20 + \$60 + \$36 + \$217 = \$333 \]

### Step 6: Calculate the Tip
James leaves a 30% tip on everything he orders.

\[ \text{Tip amount} = 0.30 \times \$333 = \$99.90 \]

### Step 7: Final Total Cost
Finally, we add the tip to the total cost before tip to get the final amount spent.

\[ \text{Final total cost} = \$333 + \$99.90 = \$432.90 \]

If the Carlo Rosi is 40 years old, what is the total age of all the listed wines?",350.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of each type of wine based on the given relationships and then sum them up.

1. **Identify the age of the Carlo Rosi:**
   \[
   \text{Carlo Rosi} = 40 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Determine the age of the Franzia wine:**
   According to the problem, the Franzia wine is three times as old as the Carlo Rosi.
   \[
   \text{Franzia} = 3 \times \text{Carlo Rosi} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Determine the age of the Silver Ridge wine:**
   The problem states that the Silver Ridge is the same age as the Franzia.
   \[
   \text{Silver Ridge} = \text{Franzia} = 120 \text{ years}
   \]

4. **Determine the age of the Twin Valley wine:**
   The problem states that the Old Vine is twice as old as the Twin Valley.
   Let \( T \) be the age of the Twin Valley.
   \[
   \text{Old Vine} = 2T
   \]
   Also, the Carlo Rosi is four times as old as the Twin Valley.
   \[
   \text{Carlo Rosi} = 4T
   \]
   Given that the Carlo Rosi is 40 years old:
   \[
   4T = 40 \implies T = 10 \text{ years}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   \text{Twin Valley} = T = 10 \text{ years}
   \]

5. **Determine the age of the Old Vine wine:**
   \[
   \text{Old Vine} = 2T = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ years}
   \]

6. **Determine the age of the Crestwood wine:**
   The problem states that the Crestwood is the same age as the Carlo Rosi.
   \[
   \text{Crestwood} = \text{Carlo Rosi} = 40 \text{ years}
   \]

7. **Sum the ages of all the wines:**
   \[
   \text{Total age} = \text{Franzia} + \text{Silver Ridge} + \text{Twin Valley} + \text{Old Vine} + \text{Crestwood}

On Sunday she rode as many kilometers as the sum of the kilometers from Monday and Saturday. How many kilometers did Natalia ride in total?,315.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Natalia rode over the week and then sum these distances.

First, let's list out the distances she rode each day:

- **Monday:** 40 kilometers
- **Tuesday:** 50 kilometers
- **Wednesday:** 25 kilometers
- **Thursday:** 65 kilometers
- **Friday:** 30 kilometers
- **Saturday:** 50% fewer kilometers than Thursday
- **Sunday:** As many kilometers as the sum of the kilometers from Monday and Saturday

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Calculate the distance ridden on Saturday:**
   - Distance on Thursday = 65 kilometers
   - 50% fewer means she rode 50% less than 65 kilometers.
   - 50% of 65 kilometers = \( \frac{50}{100} \times 65 = 32.5 \) kilometers
   - Therefore, the distance on Saturday = \( 65 - 32.5 = 32.5 \) kilometers

2. **Calculate the distance ridden on Sunday:**
   - Distance on Monday = 40 kilometers
   - Distance on Saturday = 32.5 kilometers
   - Sum of Monday and Saturday = \( 40 + 32.5 = 72.5 \) kilometers
   - Therefore, the distance on Sunday = 72.5 kilometers

Now, let's add up all the distances:

- **Monday:** 40 kilometers
- **Tuesday:** 50 kilometers
- **Wednesday:** 25 kilometers
- **Thursday:** 65 kilometers
- **Friday:** 30 kilometers
- **Saturday:** 32.5 kilometers
- **Sunday:** 72.5 kilometers

Summing these distances:

\[
40 + 50 + 25 + 65 + 30 + 32.5 + 72.5

\[
90 + 25 = 115
\]
\[
115 + 65 = 180

\[
210 + 32.5 = 242.5

How many 10 oz servings of punch does Carrie have?",23.0,"To determine how many 10 oz servings of punch Carrie has, we need to first calculate the total volume of all the ingredients she uses.

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Mountain Dew:**
   - Carrie uses 6 cans of Mountain Dew, each 12 oz.
   \[
   6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ oz}
   \]

2. **Ice:**

Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane and three times as many pieces of bread as treats. Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane and twice as many pieces of bread as treats. Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda and half as many pieces of bread as treats. Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda and four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats. If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",396.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pieces of bread and treats each person brings to the zoo based on the given information and then sum these amounts.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of treats Wanda brings:**
   - We know that Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread.
   - According to the problem, Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats.
   - Let \( T_W \) be the number of treats Wanda brings.
   - Therefore, \( 3T_W = 90 \).
   - Solving for \( T_W \):
     \[
     T_W = \frac{90}{3} = 30
     \]
   - So, Wanda brings 30 treats.

2. **Determine the number of treats and pieces of bread each person brings:**

   - **Jane:**
     - Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats.
     - Let \( T_J \) be the number of treats Jane brings.
     - Then, the number of pieces of bread Jane brings is \( 0.75T_J \).
     - Since \( T_W = 30 \), we assume \( T_J = T_W = 30 \) (since no other information is provided about Jane's treats).
     - Therefore, the number of pieces of bread Jane brings is:
       \[
       0.75 \times 30 = 22.5
       \]
     - So, Jane brings 22.5 pieces of bread and 30 treats.

   - **Wanda:**
     - We already determined that Wanda brings 30 treats and 90 pieces of bread.

   - **Carlos:**
     - Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane.
     - Therefore, the number of treats Carlos brings is:
       \[
       \frac{T_J}{3} = \frac{30}{3} = 10
       \]
     - Carlos brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats.
     - Therefore, the number of pieces of bread Carlos brings is:
       \[
       2 \times 10 = 20
       \]
     - So, Carlos brings 20 pieces of bread and 10 treats.

   - **Mia:**
     - Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda.
     - Therefore, the number of treats Mia brings is:
       \[
       T_W - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20
       \]
     - Mia brings half as many pieces of bread as treats.
     - Therefore, the number of pieces of bread Mia brings is:
       \[
       \frac{T_M}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
       \]
     - So, Mia brings 10 pieces of bread and 20 treats.

   - **Omar:**
     - Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda.
     - Therefore, the number of treats Omar brings is:
       \[
       1.5 \times T_W = 1.5 \times 30 = 45
       \]
     - Omar brings four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats.
     - Therefore, the number of pieces of bread Omar brings is:
       \[
       \frac{4}{5} \times 45 = 36
       \]
     - So, Omar brings 36 pieces of bread and 45 treats.

3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of bread and treats:**

   - **Total pieces of bread:**
     \[
     22.5 + 90 + 20 + 10 + 36 = 178.5
     \]

   - **Total treats:**
     \[
     30 + 30 + 10 + 20 + 45 = 135

6. **Jane's Rehabilitation Centers:**
   - Jane visited 6 more than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Han.
   \[
   Jn = 2H + 6 = 2 \times 4 + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14

- Chen: \( C = 12 \)
- Jude: \( J = 3 \)
- Omar: \( O = 6 \)
- Han: \( H = 4 \)
- Jane: \( Jn = 14 \)

1. **Pencil Length:**
   - Given: The pencil is 12 centimeters long.
   - Let \( P \) represent the length of the pencil.
   - Therefore, \( P = 12 \) cm.

2. **Marker Length:**
   - Given: The marker is 1 centimeter longer than the pencil.
   - Let \( M \) represent the length of the marker.
   - Therefore, \( M = P + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13 \) cm.

3. **Ruler Length:**
   - Given: The ruler is twice as long as the pencil.
   - Let \( R \) represent the length of the ruler.
   - Therefore, \( R = 2P = 2 \times 12 = 24 \) cm.

4. **Pen Length:**
   - Given: The pen is shorter than the pencil by 2 centimeters.
   - Let \( Pen \) represent the length of the pen.

5. **Rubber Length:**
   - Given: The pen is longer than the rubber by 3 centimeters.
   - Let \( Rubber \) represent the length of the rubber.
   - Therefore, \( Pen = Rubber + 3 \).
   - Substituting the value of \( Pen \):

- Ruler (\( R \)) = 24 cm
- Pen (\( Pen \)) = 10 cm
- Rubber (\( Rubber \)) = 7 cm
- Crayon (\( Crayon \)) = 5 cm

To find the total length of all these items, we sum their lengths:
\[
Total = P + M + R + Pen + Rubber + Crayon

If his farm produced 400 kg of mangoes and he sold the fruits at $50 per kg, calculate the total amount of money he got in that season.",145000.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total produce of each type of fruit and then calculate the total revenue from selling all the fruits at $50 per kg.

Let's denote the total produce of mangoes as \( M \). According to the problem, \( M = 400 \) kg.

1. **Total produce of apples (\( A \))**:
   - The total produce of apples was twice the total produce of mangoes.
   \[
   A = 2M = 2 \times 400 = 800 \text{ kg}
   \]

2. **Total produce of oranges (\( O \))**:
   - The total produce of oranges was 200 kg more than that of mangoes.
   \[
   O = M + 200 = 400 + 200 = 600 \text{ kg}

3. **Total produce of bananas (\( B \))**:
   - He produced 100 kg fewer bananas than apples.

4. **Total produce of peaches (\( P \))**:
   - The total produce of peaches was half the total produce of oranges.
   \[
   P = \frac{O}{2} = \frac{600}{2} = 300 \text{ kg}

5. **Total produce of guavas (\( G \))**:
   - He harvested one-fourth as many guavas as mangoes.
   \[
   G = \frac{M}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ kg}

How much does John pay for the first year?,34760.0,"To determine how much John pays for the first year, we need to calculate the total costs for the family and then find out what half of that amount is.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Joining Fee:**
   - There are 4 people (John and his 3 family members).
   - The joining fee is $4000 per person.
   - Total joining fee = \( 4 \times 4000 = 16000 \) dollars.

2. **Monthly Cost:**
   - Monthly cost per person = $1000.
   - Number of months in a year = 12.
   - Total monthly cost for all 4 people = \( 4 \times 1000 \times 12 = 48000 \) dollars.

3. **Annual Maintenance Fee:**
   - Annual maintenance fee per person = $600.
   - Total annual maintenance fee for all 4 people = \( 4 \times 600 = 2400 \) dollars.

4. **Gym Access:**
   - Gym access per person per month = $50.
   - Number of months in a year = 12.
   - Total gym access cost for all 4 people = \( 4 \times 50 \times 12 = 2400 \) dollars.

5. **Guest Passes:**
   - Each person buys 2 guest passes per month.
   - Cost per guest pass = $30.
   - Number of guests per month = 4 (John and his 3 family members).
   - Total guest passes cost per month = \( 4 \times 2 \times 30 = 240 \) dollars.
   - Total guest passes cost for a year = \( 240 \times 12 = 2880 \) dollars.

### Total Annual Cost for the Family:

He also buys 4 alpacas that cost 25% less each than a llama. He buys 2 zebras that cost twice as much as a goat each. He buys as many ponies as goats, and each pony costs $100 more than a goat. How much did he spend?",9700.0,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of goats
Tim buys 3 goats at $400 each.
\[
\text{Total cost for goats} = 3 \times 400 = 1200
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number and cost of llamas
Tim buys twice as many llamas as goats, so he buys \(2 \times 3 = 6\) llamas.
The cost of each llama is 50% more than a goat, so each llama costs:
\[
400 \times 1.5 = 600
\]
Thus, the total cost for llamas is:
\[
6 \times 600 = 3600
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number and cost of alpacas
Tim buys 4 alpacas, and each alpaca costs 25% less than a llama. The cost of each alpaca is:
\[
600 \times (1 - 0.25) = 600 \times 0.75 = 450
\]
Thus, the total cost for alpacas is:
\[
4 \times 450 = 1800
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of zebras
Tim buys 2 zebras, and each zebra costs twice as much as a goat. Each zebra costs:
\[
400 \times 2 = 800
\]
Thus, the total cost for zebras is:
\[
2 \times 800 = 1600
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the number and cost of ponies
Tim buys as many ponies as goats, so he buys 3 ponies. Each pony costs $100 more than a goat, so each pony costs:
\[
400 + 100 = 500
\]
Thus, the total cost for ponies is:
\[
3 \times 500 = 1500
\]

### Step 6: Sum up all the costs
Now we sum up the costs from all the animals:
\[
1200 \text{ (goats)} + 3600 \text{ (llamas)} + 1800 \text{ (alpacas)} + 1600 \text{ (zebras)} + 1500 \text{ (ponies)}

Next, Zelda the zany zebra stands on her back legs for 4 minutes more than Pulsar. After that, Trixie the tiny tiger stands on her back legs for twice as long as Petra. What is the combined length of time, in minutes, that all the entertainers mentioned stand on their back legs?",84.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the duration each entertainer stands on their back legs and then sum these durations.

1. **Determine the time Pulsar stands on his back legs:**
   \[
   \text{Time Pulsar stands} = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Determine the time Polly stands on her back legs:**
   Polly stands on her back legs for three times as long as Pulsar.
   \[
   \text{Time Polly stands} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Determine the time Petra stands on her back legs:**
   Petra stands on her back legs for one-sixth as long as Polly.
   \[
   \text{Time Petra stands} = \frac{30}{6} = 5 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Determine the time Marvin the mischievous monkey stands on his back legs:**
   Marvin stands on his back legs for half as long as Polly.
   \[
   \text{Time Marvin stands} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Determine the time Zelda the zany zebra stands on her back legs:**
   Zelda stands on her back legs for 4 minutes more than Pulsar.
   \[
   \text{Time Zelda stands} = 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Determine the time Trixie the tiny tiger stands on her back legs:**
   Trixie stands on her back legs for twice as long as Petra.
   \[
   \text{Time Trixie stands} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, we sum up the times for all the entertainers:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time Pulsar stands} + \text{Time Polly stands} + \text{Time Petra stands} + \text{Time Marvin stands} + \text{Time Zelda stands} + \text{Time Trixie stands}
\]
\[
\text{Total time} = 10 + 30 + 5 + 15 + 14 + 10
\]

Adding these values together:

\[
10 + 30 = 40
\]
\[
40 + 5 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 15 = 60
\]
\[
60 + 14 = 74
\]
\[
74 + 10 = 84

Under optimal wind conditions, the use of two sails brings the ship to the speed of 50 knots, whereas under the same conditions, the use of one sail brings her ship to the speed of 25 knots. A knot is a nautical term for speed equal to 1 nautical mile per hour, and one nautical mile equals 1.15 land miles. If she travels in her sailboat under optimal wind conditions for 4 hours with one sail and then for another 4 hours with two sails, Under the same conditions, the use of three sails brings the ship to the speed of 60 knots, and she sails for 1 hour using three sails. Under the same conditions, the use of four sails brings the ship to the speed of 70 knots, and she sails for 2 hours using four sails. Under the same conditions, sailing with one reefed sail brings her ship to the speed of 15 knots, and she sails for 4 hours with a reefed sail. what is the total distance, in land miles, that she will travel?",644.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance traveled under each condition and then sum these distances.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Distance traveled with one sail for 4 hours:**
   - Speed with one sail = 25 knots
   - Time = 4 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 25 knots × 4 hours = 100 nautical miles

2. **Distance traveled with two sails for 4 hours:**
   - Speed with two sails = 50 knots
   - Time = 4 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 50 knots × 4 hours = 200 nautical miles

3. **Distance traveled with three sails for 1 hour:**
   - Speed with three sails = 60 knots
   - Time = 1 hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 knots × 1 hour = 60 nautical miles

4. **Distance traveled with four sails for 2 hours:**
   - Speed with four sails = 70 knots
   - Time = 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 70 knots × 2 hours = 140 nautical miles

5. **Distance traveled with one reefed sail for 4 hours:**
   - Speed with one reefed sail = 15 knots
   - Time = 4 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 15 knots × 4 hours = 60 nautical miles

### Summing the Distances:

Now, we add up all the distances calculated above:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 100 \text{ nautical miles} + 200 \text{ nautical miles} + 60 \text{ nautical miles} + 140 \text{ nautical miles} + 60 \text{ nautical miles}
\]

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 560 \text{ nautical miles}
\]

### Converting Nautical Miles to Land Miles:

Since 1 nautical mile = 1.15 land miles, we convert the total distance from nautical miles to land miles:

\[
\text{Total Distance in Land Miles} = 560 \text{ nautical miles} \times 1.15 \text{ land miles/nautical mile}
\]

\[
\text{Total Distance in Land Miles} = 644 \text{ land miles}

How much is Peter's remaining money?",376.0,"To determine how much money Peter has left after his purchases, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of item he bought and then subtract this total from the initial amount of $500.

1. **Potatoes:**
   - Quantity: 6 kilos
   - Price per kilo: $2
   - Total cost: \( 6 \text{ kilos} \times \$2/\text{kilo} = \$12 \)

2. **Tomato:**
   - Quantity: 9 kilos
   - Price per kilo: $3

- 1 piece of cake: \(1 \times 7 = 7\)
- 1 bowl of ice cream: \(1 \times 3 = 3\)
- Total for each friend: \(8 + 7 + 3 = 18\)

### Nina's Order
- 2 cups of coffee: \(2 \times 4 = 8\)
- 1 piece of cake: \(1 \times 7 = 7\)
- 2 bowls of ice cream: \(2 \times 3 = 6\)

7,qwen-3B,Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct,3,44,43,"Manny is making lasagna for dinner with his four friends, Lisa, Raphael, Aaron, and Kai. He needs to know how many pieces to cut the lasagna into to serve it. Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Another friend, Nora, is picky and will only eat one-third of what Manny eats, and Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. Another friend, Ben, will eat the same amount of lasagna as Kai. Another friend, Tina, loves lasagna and will eat 3 pieces. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",12.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much lasagna each person will eat and then sum these amounts to find out how many pieces Manny should cut the lasagna into.

1. **Manny's portion:**
   Manny will eat 1 piece.

2. **Aaron's portion:**
   Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad, so he will eat 0 pieces.

3. **Kai's portion:**
   Kai will eat twice as much as Manny. Since Manny eats 1 piece, Kai will eat \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pieces.

4. **Raphael's portion:**
   Raphael will eat half the amount Manny does. Since Manny eats 1 piece, Raphael will eat \( \frac{1}{2} \times 1 = 0.5 \) pieces.

5. **Lisa's portion:**
   Lisa will eat 2 pieces plus any leftover from Raphael. Since Raphael eats 0.5 pieces, Lisa will eat \(2 + (0.5 - 0.5) = 2\) pieces (since any leftover from Raphael is 0).

6. **Nora's portion:**
   Nora will eat one-third of what Manny eats. Since Manny eats 1 piece, Nora will eat \( \frac{1}{3} \times 1 = \frac{1}{3} \) piece. The remaining portion for Nora will be \(1 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}\). Since Lisa will eat 2 pieces, and assuming Lisa eats all her piece first, the remaining portion for Nora will be \( \frac{2}{3} - 2 = -\frac{4}{3} \), which is not possible since she can't eat negative pieces. Therefore, we need to consider that Lisa will eat her full 2 pieces first, leaving no portion for Nora. So, Nora will eat 0 pieces.

7. **Ben's portion:**
   Ben will eat the same amount as Kai, so he will eat 2 pieces.

8. **Tina's portion:**
   Tina will eat 3 pieces.

Now, let's sum up all the portions:

- Manny: 1 piece
- Aaron: 0 pieces
- Kai: 2 pieces
- Raphael: 0.5 pieces
- Lisa: 2 pieces
- Nora: 0 pieces
- Ben: 2 pieces
- Tina: 3 pieces

Total pieces = \(1 + 0 + 2 + 0.5 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 10.5\)

Since Manny can't cut a lasagna into a fraction of a piece, he should cut it into whole pieces. Therefore, he should cut the lasagna into 11 pieces to ensure everyone gets enough.

His company has 5 sectors with different t-shirt colors. Two sectors use white t-shirts and black t-shirts. He paid $20 for white men's t-shirts and $18 for black men's t-shirts. He paid $22 for blue men's t-shirts. He paid $21 for red men's t-shirts. He paid $19 for green men's t-shirts. Each sector has 10 men and 10 women, so there are 100 employees in total. How much did he spend total on buying t-shirts?",1750.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost Juan spent on buying t-shirts for both men and women across all sectors. We will break down the costs step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost for each sector

#### Sector 1 (White Men's T-Shirts)
- Number of men: 10
- Cost per white men's t-shirt: $20
- Total cost for white men's t-shirts: \( 10 \times 20 = \$200 \)

#### Sector 2 (Black Men's T-Shirts)
- Number of men: 10
- Cost per black men's t-shirt: $18
- Total cost for black men's t-shirts: \( 10 \times 18 = \$180 \)

#### Sector 3 (Blue Men's T-Shirts)
- Number of men: 10
- Cost per blue men's t-shirt: $22
- Total cost for blue men's t-shirts: \( 10 \times 22 = \$220 \)

#### Sector 4 (Red Men's T-Shirts)
- Number of men: 10
- Cost per red men's t-shirt: $21
- Total cost for red men's t-shirts: \( 10 \times 21 = \$210 \)

#### Sector 5 (Green Men's T-Shirts)
- Number of men: 10
- Cost per green men's t-shirt: $19
- Total cost for green men's t-shirts: \( 10 \times 19 = \$190 \)

### Step 2: Calculate the cost for women in each sector

Since women's t-shirts are $5 cheaper than men's t-shirts of the same color:

#### Sector 1 (White Women's T-Shirts)
- Cost per white women's t-shirt: \( 20 - 5 = \$15 \)
- Total cost for white women's t-shirts: \( 10 \times 15 = \$150 \)

#### Sector 2 (Black Women's T-Shirts)
- Cost per black women's t-shirt: \( 18 - 5 = \$13 \)
- Total cost for black women's t-shirts: \( 10 \times 13 = \$130 \)

#### Sector 3 (Blue Women's T-Shirts)
- Cost per blue women's t-shirt: \( 22 - 5 = \$17 \)
- Total cost for blue women's t-shirts: \( 10 \times 17 = \$170 \)

#### Sector 4 (Red Women's T-Shirts)
- Cost per red women's t-shirt: \( 21 - 5 = \$16 \)
- Total cost for red women's t-shirts: \( 10 \times 16 = \$160 \)

#### Sector 5 (Green Women's T-Shirts)
- Cost per green women's t-shirt: \( 19 - 5 = \$14 \)
- Total cost for green women's t-shirts: \( 10 \times 14 = \$140 \)

### Step 3: Sum up the total cost for all sectors

Now, we sum up the costs from all sectors:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Total cost for white men} & : \$200 \\
\text{Total cost for black men} & : \$180 \\
\text{Total cost for blue men} & : \$220 \\
\text{Total cost for red men} & : \$210 \\
\text{Total cost for green men} & : \$190 \\
\text{Total cost for white women} & : \$150 \\
\text{Total cost for black women} & : \$130 \\
\text{Total cost for blue women} & : \$170 \\
\text{Total cost for red women} & : \$160 \\
\text{Total cost for green women} & : \$140 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Adding these together:

\[
\begin{align*}
\$200 + \$180 + \$220 + \$210 + \$190 &= \$1000 \\
\$150 + \$130 + \$170 + \$160 + \$140 &= \$750 \\

He also has 10 crickets. What is the total number of legs in his entire collection?,250.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of creature Monroe has and then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Spiders:**
   - Each spider has 8 legs.
   - Monroe has 8 spiders.
   - Total legs from spiders = \( 8 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs/spider} = 64 \text{ legs} \).

2. **Ants:**
   - Each ant has 6 legs.
   - Monroe has 12 ants.
   - Total legs from ants = \( 12 \text{ ants} \times 6 \text{ legs/ant} = 72 \text{ legs} \).

3. **Beetles:**
   - Each beetle has 6 legs.
   - Monroe has 5 beetles.
   - Total legs from beetles = \( 5 \text{ beetles} \times 6 \text{ legs/beetle} = 30 \text{ legs} \).

4. **Scorpions:**
   - Each scorpion has 8 legs.
   - Monroe has 3 scorpions.
   - Total legs from scorpions = \( 3 \text{ scorpions} \times 8 \text{ legs/scorpion} = 24 \text{ legs} \).

5. **Crickets:**
   - Each cricket has 6 legs.
   - Monroe has 10 crickets.
   - Total legs from crickets = \( 10 \text{ crickets} \times 6 \text{ legs/cricket} = 60 \text{ legs} \).

### Summing Up All Legs:
Now, we add up all the legs from each type of creature:
\[
64 \text{ (spiders)} + 72 \text{ (ants)} + 30 \text{ (beetles)} + 24 \text{ (scorpions)} + 60 \text{ (crickets)}

For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs. The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs. The machine has twice as many orange gumballs as blue gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",93.0,"Let's break down the information given and solve it step by step.

1. **Red Gumballs (R):**
   - Given: \( R = 16 \)

2. **Blue Gumballs (B):**
   - The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs.
   - Therefore, \( B = \frac{R}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \)

3. **Green Gumballs (G):**
   - For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs.
   - Therefore, \( G = 4 \times B = 4 \times 8 = 32 \)

4. **Yellow Gumballs (Y):**
   - The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs.
   - Therefore, \( Y = B = 8 \)

5. **Purple Gumballs (P):**
   - The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs.
   - Therefore, \( P = R - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \)

6. **Orange Gumballs (O):**
   - The machine has twice as many orange gumballs as blue gumballs.
   - Therefore, \( O = 2 \times B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \)

Now, we sum up all the gumballs to find the total number of gumballs in the machine:

\[
\text{Total Gumballs} = R + B + G + Y + P + O
\]

Substituting the values we found:

\[
\text{Total Gumballs} = 16 + 8 + 32 + 8 + 13 + 16
\]

Adding these together:

\[
16 + 8 = 24
\]
\[
24 + 32 = 56
\]
\[
56 + 8 = 64
\]
\[
64 + 13 = 77
\]
\[
77 + 16 = 93
\]

Therefore, the total number of gumballs in the machine is:
