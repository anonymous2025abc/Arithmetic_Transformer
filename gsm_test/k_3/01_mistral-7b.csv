Alice has 5 times as many sheep as Bob. Bob has 3 times as many sheep as David. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle, Alice, Bob and David have together if David has 20 sheep?",8180.0,"Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let x be the number of sheep in each city except for David, who has 20 sheep.

1. Toulouse has 2 times as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2x sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4x sheep.
3. Seattle has 2 times as many sheep as Alice, so Seattle has 2x/2 = x/2 sheep.
4. Alice has 5 times as many sheep as Bob, so Alice has 5x sheep.
5. Bob has 3 times as many sheep as David, so Bob has 3*20 = 60 sheep.
6. Since Alice has 5 times as many sheep as Bob, Alice has 5*60 = 300 sheep.
7. Now we know that Alice has 300 sheep, and Seattle has x/2 sheep. Since Seattle has 2 times as many sheep as Alice, x/2 = 300/2, so x = 300.
8. Now we can find the number of sheep in each city: Toulouse has 2x = 2*300 = 600 sheep, Charleston has 4x = 4*300 = 1200 sheep, and Seattle has x/2 = 300/2 = 150 sheep.

Now let's find the total number of sheep: Toulouse + Charleston + Seattle + Alice + Bob + David = 600 + 1200 + 150 + 300 + 60 + 20 = 2330 sheep.

1. Let A be the number of antelopes, R be the number of rabbits, H be the number of hyenas, W be the number of wild dogs, L be the number of leopards, Z be the number of zebras, and B be the number of buffaloes.

2. We know that A + R = A + 34 (since there are 34 more rabbits than antelopes).

3. We also know that A + R + H = A + R + A + R + 42 (since there are 42 fewer hyenas than the total number of antelopes and rabbits combined).

4. Simplifying the above equation gives us 2A + 3R + 42 = 2(A + R) + 42.

5. Since there are 50 more wild dogs than hyenas, we have W = A + R + 50 - H.

6. The number of leopards is half the number of rabbits, so L = R/2.

7. There are twice as many zebras as leopards, so Z = 2L = 2(R/2) = R.

8. There are 3 fewer giraffes than zebras, so G = Z - 3 = R - 3.

9. There are half as many buffaloes as antelopes and rabbits combined, so B = (A + R)/2.

Total fish = Fish of Micah + Fish of Kenneth + Fish of Liam + Fish of Matthias + Fish of Noah + Fish of Owen
Total fish = 7 + 21 + 16 + 6 + 49 + 18 = 117

1. In the first 5 seconds:
   - Fireflies scored 7 * 3 = 21 points (3-point baskets)
   - Hornets scored 2 * 2 = 4 points (2-point baskets)

2. In the next 3 seconds:
   - Fireflies scored 1 * 2 = 2 points (2-point baskets)

1. Necklaces: The necklace stand can hold 12 necklaces, but currently holds 5. So, we need 12 - 5 = 7 more necklaces. The cost for these would be 7 * $4 = $28.

2. Rings: The ring display can hold 30 rings, but currently holds 18. So, we need 30 - 18 = 12 more rings. The cost for these would be 12 * $10 = $120.

3. Bracelets: The bracelet display can hold 15 bracelets, but currently holds 8. So, we need 15 - 8 = 7 more bracelets. The cost for these would be 7 * $5 = $35.

4. Watches: The watch display can hold 20 watches, but currently holds 7. So, we need 20 - 7 = 13 more watches. The cost for these would be 13 * $25 = $325.

If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?",320.0,"Let's break this down:

1. Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so she collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles.

2. Tom collected three times as many red marbles as Mary, so he collected 3 * 60 = 180 red marbles.

3. Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary, so she collected 60 + 20 = 80 red marbles.

4. Sara collected 10 fewer red marbles than Anie, so she collected 80 - 10 = 70 red marbles.

5. Anie collected half the number of blue marbles collected by Jenny, so she collected 25 / 2 = 12.5 blue marbles (since the number of blue marbles must be a whole number, we'll round this down to 12).

6. Sara collected five times as many blue marbles as Mary. Since Mary didn't collect any blue marbles, Sara collected 5 * 0 = 0 blue marbles (this is a mistake in the problem statement, as it's impossible for Sara to collect zero blue marbles). Let's assume that Mary collected some non-zero number of blue marbles to make the problem solvable.

7. Leo collected three times as many red marbles as Jenny, so he collected 3 * 30 = 90 red marbles.

8. Leo collected three times as many blue marbles as Jenny, so he collected 3 * 25 = 75 blue marbles.

Now, let's find the total number of blue marbles collected by all friends. We know the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, Sara, and Leo, but we don't know the number of blue marbles collected by Mary. Let's denote the number of blue marbles collected by Mary as x.

The total number of blue marbles collected by all friends is:

12 (Anie) + 0 (Sara) + 75 (Leo) + x (Mary)

Since Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, we have the equation:

12 + 75 + x = 25 + (number of blue marbles collected by Jenny)

From the problem statement, we know that Jenny collected 25 blue marbles, so the equation becomes:

12 + 75 + x = 25 + 25

Solving for x, we get:

x = 100 - 12 - 75 = 13

2. From the problem, we have the following relationships:
   - Jane visited 6 more than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Han, so x = 2h + 6
   - Han visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude, so h = 2j - 2
   - Jude visited half as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa, so j = l/2
   - Omar visited 3 more rehabilitation centers than Jude, so o = j + 3 = (l/2) + 3
   - Priya visited 1 less than three times as many rehabilitation centers as Han, so p = 3h - 1 = 3(2j - 2) - 1 = 6j - 3

4. Eli got 5 more questions correct than Carla (14 + 5 = 19 questions correct) and half as many questions wrong as Carla (12 / 2 = 6 questions wrong).
5. Sasha got twice as many questions correct as the number of questions Drew got wrong (2 * 6 = 12 questions correct) and 4 fewer questions wrong than Carla (12 - 4 = 8 questions wrong).

Now let's find the total number of questions asked in the competition. Since each competitor was asked a different question, the total number of questions is equal to the sum of the correct answers for all competitors:

Total questions = Drew's correct answers + Carla's correct answers + Maya's correct answers + Eli's correct answers + Sasha's correct answers

We can now calculate the correct answers for each competitor:
- Drew: 20 questions correct
- Carla: 14 questions correct
- Maya: 17 questions correct (3 fewer than Drew)
- Eli: 19 questions correct (5 more than Carla)
- Sasha: 12 questions correct (twice the number of questions Drew got wrong)

Now we can add up the correct answers for all competitors:

Total questions = 20 + 14 + 17 + 19 + 12 = 72 questions

So, there were 72 questions asked in the competition.

1. Apples = 2 * Mangoes (since the total produce of apples was twice that of mangoes)
   Apples = 2 * 400 kg = 800 kg

2. Oranges = Mangoes + 200 kg (since the total produce of oranges was 200 kg more than that of mangoes)
   Oranges = 400 kg + 200 kg = 600 kg

3. Peaches = 0.5 * Oranges (since the total produce of peaches was half the total produce of oranges)
   Peaches = 0.5 * 600 kg = 300 kg

4. Guavas = 0.25 * Mangoes (since he harvested one-fourth as many guavas as mangoes)
   Guavas = 0.25 * 400 kg = 100 kg

5. Bananas = Apples - 100 kg (since he produced 100 kg fewer bananas than apples)
   Bananas = 800 kg - 100 kg = 700 kg

Now, let's find the total amount of money he got from selling all the fruits:

Total amount of money = (Price per kg of mangoes * Mangoes) + (Price per kg of apples * Apples) + (Price per kg of oranges * Oranges) + (Price per kg of peaches * Peaches) + (Price per kg of guavas * Guavas) + (Price per kg of bananas * Bananas)

The family buys 2 guest passes each month at $30 each. John agrees to pay half the total cost for the whole family. How much does John pay for the first year?,34760.0,"First, let's calculate the one-time joining fee for John and his family members:

Joining fee per person = $4000
Number of family members = 4 (John + 3 family members)
Total joining fee for the family = Joining fee per person * Number of family members = $4000 * 4 = $16000

Next, let's calculate the monthly costs for each person:

Monthly cost per person for club membership = $1000
Monthly cost per person for gym access = $50

Total monthly cost per person = Monthly cost per person for club membership + Monthly cost per person for gym access = $1050

Now, let's calculate the total monthly cost for the family:

Total monthly cost for the family = Total monthly cost per person * Number of family members = $1050 * 4 = $4200

Since there are 12 months in a year, the annual cost for the family is:

Annual cost for the family = Total monthly cost for the family * 12 = $4200 * 12 = $49,200

Now, let's calculate the annual maintenance fee for the family:

Annual maintenance fee per person = $600
Total annual maintenance fee for the family = Annual maintenance fee per person * Number of family members = $600 * 4 = $2400

Next, let's calculate the cost of the guest passes:

Number of guest passes per month = 2
Cost of each guest pass = $30
Total cost of guest passes per month = Number of guest passes per month * Cost of each guest pass = 2 * $30 = $60
Total cost of guest passes for the year = Total cost of guest passes per month * 12 = $60 * 12 = $720

Now, let's calculate the total cost for John to pay:

Total cost for John to pay = (Annual cost for the family + Total annual maintenance fee for the family + Total cost of guest passes for the year) / 2 = ($49,200 + $2400 + $720) / 2 = $50,320 / 2 = $25,160

Safari National park also has twice as many zebras as giraffes. Savanna National park has half as many zebras as lions. Safari National park also has 5 fewer elephants than snakes. Savanna National park has 20 more elephants than Safari National park. Safari National park also has three times as many monkeys as giraffes. Savanna National park has 10 fewer monkeys than its zebras. How many animals in total does Savanna National park have?",665.0,"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Safari National park has 100 lions, half as many snakes (let's call this S), and 10 fewer giraffes than snakes, so Safari has G = S + 10. It also has twice as many zebras as giraffes, so Safari has Z = 2(G - 10) = 2(S + 10) - 20.

2. Savanna National park has double as many lions as Safari National park, so Savanna has 2 * 100 = 200 lions. It has triple as many snakes as Safari National park, so Savanna has 3 * S = 3S. It has 20 more elephants than Safari National park, so Savanna has E = S + 20 + number of elephants in Safari.

3. Savanna National park has half as many zebras as lions, so Savanna has Z = 0.5 * 200 = 100 zebras.

4. Savanna National park also has 10 fewer monkeys than its zebras, so Savanna has M = Z - 10 = 100 - 10 = 90 monkeys.

5. We know that Safari National park has 5 fewer elephants than snakes, so the number of elephants in Safari is E_S = S - 5. Since Savanna has E = S + 20 + E_S, we can rearrange this to find the number of elephants in Safari: E_S = E - 20 - S = S - 20 - 5.

6. We know that Safari National park also has three times as many monkeys as giraffes, so Safari has M_S = 3 * (G - 10). Since Savanna has M = 90 and M = M_S + 10, we can find the number of monkeys in Safari: M_S = 90 - 10 = 80. This means G - 10 = 80 / 3, so G = 80 * 3 / 3 + 10 = 241.

7. Now we know the number of giraffes in Safari, so we can find the number of zebras in Safari: Z_S = 2 * (241 - 10) - 20 = 461 - 20 = 441.

8. Since Savanna has twice as many zebras as Safari, Savanna has 2 * 441 = 882 zebras.

9. Now we know the number of lions, snakes, elephants, zebras, and monkeys in both parks. We can add up all the animals in Savanna National park to find the total number of animals:

   Total animals in Savanna National park = 200 lions + 3S snakes + (S + 20 + E_S) elephants + 100 zebras + 90 monkeys

   Since E_S = S - 20 - 5, we can substitute this into the equation:

   Total animals = 200 + 3S + (S + 20 + S - 20 - 5) + 100 + 90

   Simplifying this gives us:

   Total animals = 200 + 3S + S + 195 = 3S + 401

   Since we know that G = 241, we can find S = G / 2 = 241 / 2 = 120.5. However, since we cannot have half a snake, we round this down to 120.

   So, the total number of animals in Savanna National park is Total animals = 3 * 120 + 401 = 360 + 401 = 761 animals.

1. Goats: Tim buys 3 goats at $400 each. So, the cost for goats is 3 * $400 = $1200.

2. Llamas: Tim gets twice as many llamas as goats, so he gets 3 * 2 = 6 llamas. Since they cost 50% more than a goat, the cost for each llama is $400 * 1.5 = $600. So, the cost for llamas is 6 * $600 = $3600.

3. Alpacas: Each alpaca costs 25% less than a llama, so the cost for each alpaca is $600 * 0.75 = $450. Since he buys as many alpacas as goats, the number of alpacas is also 3. So, the cost for alpacas is 3 * $450 = $1350.

4. Zebras: Each zebra costs twice as much as a goat, so the cost for each zebra is $400 * 2 = $800. Since he buys 2 zebras, the cost for zebras is 2 * $800 = $1600.

5. Ponies: He buys as many ponies as goats, so the number of ponies is also 3. Each pony costs $100 more than a goat, so the cost for each pony is $400 + $100 = $500. So, the cost for ponies is 3 * $500 = $1500.

$18 (Mell) + $36 (2 friends with the same order as Mell) + $42 (Nina) + $18 (2 friends with 1 cup of coffee and 2 bowls of ice cream) + $15 (Omar) = $127

1,mistral-7b,mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3,3,44,43,"Manny is making lasagna for dinner with his four friends, Lisa, Raphael, Aaron, and Kai. He needs to know how many pieces to cut the lasagna into to serve it. Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Another friend, Nora, is picky and will only eat one-third of what Manny eats, and Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. Another friend, Ben, will eat the same amount of lasagna as Kai. Another friend, Tina, loves lasagna and will eat 3 pieces. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",12.0,"First, let's calculate the amount of lasagna each person will eat, excluding Manny:

1. Aaron will not eat lasagna, so he won't affect the number of pieces.
2. Kai will eat twice as much as Manny, so Kai will eat 2 * Manny's pieces.
3. Raphael eats half the amount Manny does, so Raphael will eat 0.5 * Manny's pieces.
4. Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. If Raphael eats 0.5 * Manny's pieces, then Lisa will eat 2 + 0.5 * Manny's pieces - Raphael's leftovers. Since Raphael eats half of Manny's piece, there will be no leftovers for Lisa. So, Lisa will eat 2 + 0.5 * Manny's pieces = 2.5 * Manny's pieces.
5. Nora will eat one-third of what Manny eats, and Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. So, Nora will eat 1/3 * Manny's pieces, and Lisa will eat Manny's pieces - Nora's leftovers. Since Nora eats 1/3 of Manny's piece, there will be 2/3 of Manny's piece left for Lisa. So, Lisa will eat Manny's pieces - (1/3 * Manny's pieces) = (2/3) * Manny's pieces.
6. Ben will eat the same amount of lasagna as Kai, so Ben will eat 2 * Manny's pieces.
7. Tina loves lasagna and will eat 3 pieces.

Now, let's add up the amount of lasagna each person will eat:

Manny's pieces + Kai's pieces + Raphael's pieces + Lisa's pieces + Nora's leftovers + Ben's pieces + Tina's pieces

Manny's pieces = Total amount of lasagna / (1 + Kai + Raphael + Lisa + Nora + Ben + Tina)

Since we know the amount of lasagna each person will eat, we can calculate the total amount of lasagna needed:

Total amount of lasagna = Manny's pieces + Kai's pieces + Raphael's pieces + Lisa's pieces + Nora's leftovers + Ben's pieces + Tina's pieces

Total amount of lasagna = (1 * Manny's pieces) + (2 * Manny's pieces) + (0.5 * Manny's pieces) + (2.5 * Manny's pieces) + ((1/3) * Manny's pieces) + (2 * Manny's pieces) + (3 * Manny's pieces)

Total amount of lasagna = 9.5 * Manny's pieces

Now, we can find Manny's pieces by dividing the total amount of lasagna by 9.5:

Manny's pieces = Total amount of lasagna / 9.5

Since Manny only wants one piece for himself, he should cut the lasagna into:

Number of pieces = Total amount of lasagna / 9.5 + 1

Number of pieces = (9.5 * Manny's pieces) / 9.5 + 1

Number of pieces = Manny's pieces + 1

Since we don't know the value of Manny's pieces, we can't give a specific number as the final answer. However, we can say that Manny should cut the lasagna into at least one more piece than the number of people attending the dinner (including himself). So, Manny should cut the lasagna into at least 7 pieces.",7,7.0,False,

Women's t-shirts are $5 cheaper than men's t-shirts of the same color. His company has 5 sectors with different t-shirt colors. Two sectors use white t-shirts and black t-shirts. He paid $20 for white men's t-shirts and $18 for black men's t-shirts. He paid $22 for blue men's t-shirts. He paid $21 for red men's t-shirts. He paid $19 for green men's t-shirts. Each sector has 10 men and 10 women, so there are 100 employees in total. How much did he spend total on buying t-shirts?",1750.0,"First, let's find the cost for men's t-shirts of each color. Since there are 10 men in each sector and 5 sectors, there are a total of 50 men.

For white men's t-shirts, the cost is $20.
For black men's t-shirts, the cost is $18.
For blue men's t-shirts, the cost is $22.
For red men's t-shirts, the cost is $19.
For green men's t-shirts, the cost is $19 (since it's not specified as cheaper than the others).

Since there are 2 sectors using white and black t-shirts, and each sector has the same number of each color, we can assume that there are 10 white men's t-shirts and 10 black men's t-shirts. This means there are 20 white and black men's t-shirts in total.

The cost for the remaining colors (blue, red, and green) is 50 - 20 = 30 t-shirts. Since each color has the same number of t-shirts, there are 10 t-shirts of each remaining color.

Now, let's find the cost for women's t-shirts. Since women's t-shirts are $5 cheaper than men's t-shirts of the same color, we can subtract $5 from the cost of men's t-shirts for each women's t-shirt.

For white women's t-shirts, the cost is $20 - $5 = $15.
For black women's t-shirts, the cost is $18 - $5 = $13.
For blue women's t-shirts, the cost is $22 - $5 = $17.
For red women's t-shirts, the cost is $19 - $5 = $14.
For green women's t-shirts, the cost is $19 (since it's not specified as cheaper than the others).

Since there are 10 women in each sector and 5 sectors, there are a total of 50 women.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for women's t-shirts. Since there are 10 women in each sector, there are 5 white women's t-shirts and 5 black women's t-shirts. The cost for these is 5 * $15 + 5 * $13 = $75 + $65 = $140.

For the remaining colors (blue, red, and green), since each color has the same number of t-shirts, there are 10 women for each color. The cost for these is 10 * $17 + 10 * $14 + 50 * $19 = $170 + $140 + $950 = $1160.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for men's t-shirts. The cost for white and black men's t-shirts is 20 * $20 + 20 * $18 = $400 + $360 = $760. The cost for the remaining colors (blue, red, and green) is 30 * $22 + 30 * $19 = $660 + $570 = $1230.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost for t-shirts. The total cost for men's t-shirts is $760 + $1230 = $1990. The total cost for women's t-shirts is $140 + $1160 = $1300. The total number of t-shirts is 50 men's t-shirts + 50 women's t-shirts = 100 t-shirts.

So, the total amount Juan spent on buying t-shirts is $1990 + $1300 = $3290.

1. Billy has 10 fish.
2. Nina has 2 fewer fish than Billy, so Nina has 10 - 2 = 8 fish.
3. Priya has 4 times as many fish as Nina, so Priya has 8 * 4 = 32 fish.
4. Tony has 3 times as many fish as Billy, so Tony has 10 * 3 = 30 fish.
5. Sarah has 5 more fish than Tony, so Sarah has 30 + 5 = 35 fish.

How many stuffed animals do all the people mentioned have in all?,374.0,"First, let's find out how many stuffed animals Kenley, Tenly, and Avery have.

1. Kenley has twice as many as McKenna, so Kenley has 34 * 2 = 68 stuffed animals.
2. Tenly has 5 more than Kenley, so Tenly has 68 + 5 = 73 stuffed animals.
3. Avery has half as many stuffed animals as Kenley, so Avery has 68 / 2 = 34 stuffed animals (same as McKenna).
