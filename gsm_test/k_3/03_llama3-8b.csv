She also spends 1 minutes warm-up, 2 minutes costume changes, and 1 minutes interviews for each minute singing. If her final stage performance is 6 minutes long, what is the total combined amount of time, in minutes, that she spends practicing, throwing tantrums, singing, warm-up, costume changes and interviews in the final stage performance?",78.0,"6 minutes

Explanation:
Let x be the number of minutes that Carlotta sings on stage during the final opera performance.
Then, the number of minutes that she spends practicing is 3x.
The number of minutes that she spends throwing tantrums is 5x.
The number of minutes that she spends singing is x.
The number of minutes that she spends warm-up is x.
The number of minutes that she spends costume changes is 2x.
The number of minutes that she spends interviews is x.
The total combined amount of time, in minutes, that she spends practicing, throwing tantrums, singing, warm-up, costume changes and interviews in the final stage performance is:
3x + 5x + x + x + 2x + x = 3x + 5x + x + x + 2x + x = 12x
The total combined amount of time, in minutes, that she spends practicing, throwing tantrums, singing, warm-up, costume changes and interviews in the final stage performance is 12x.
If her final stage performance is 6 minutes long, then:
12x = 6
x = 6/12
x = 1/2
The total combined amount of time, in minutes, that she spends practicing, throwing tantrums, singing, warm-up, costume changes and interviews in the final stage performance is 12x.
The total combined amount of time, in minutes, that she spends practicing, throwing tantrums, singing, warm-up, costume changes and interviews in the final stage performance is 12(1/2) = 6 minutes.",6,6.0,False,

There were also 10 less than five times as many purple candies as yellow candies. There were also one-fifth as many orange candies as yellow candies. If Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, how many candies remained?",620.0,"40

Explanation:
Let the number of red candies be x.
Then the number of yellow candies is 3x-20.
The number of blue candies is 3x-20/2 = 3x-10.
The number of green candies is x/2.
The number of purple candies is 5(3x-20)-10 = 15x-130.
The number of orange candies is 3x-20/5 = 3x-4.
The number of candies remaining is 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15x-130 - 3x-4 = 40 + 3x-20 - 3x-10 - x/2 - 15",15,15.0,False,

She counted 80 antelopes, 34 more rabbits than antelopes, 42 fewer hyenas than the total number of antelopes and rabbits combined, 50 more wild dogs than hyenas, and the number of leopards was half the number of rabbits. There were also twice as many zebras as leopards. There were also 3 fewer giraffes than zebras. There were also half as many buffaloes as antelopes and rabbits combined. What is the total number of animals that Josie counted?",927.0,"0.5

Explanation:
Let the number of antelopes be x.
The number of rabbits is x + 34.
The number of hyenas is x + x + 34 - 42 = 2x + 32.
The number of wild dogs is 2x + 32 + 50 = 2x + 82.
The number of leopards is (x + 34)/2 = (x + 34)/2.
The number of zebras is 2(x + 34)/2 = x + 34.
The number of giraffes is x + 34 - 3 = x + 31.
The number of buffaloes is (x + x + 34)/2 = x + 17.
The total number of animals is x + x + 34 + 2x + 32 + 2x + 82 + (x + 34)/2 + x + 34 + x + 31 + x + 17 = 6x + 250.
The total number of animals is 6x + 250.

Explanation:
The Fireflies scored 7 three-point baskets in 5 seconds, so they scored 1.4 three-point baskets per second. The Hornets scored 2 two-point baskets in 5 seconds, so they scored 0.4 two-point baskets per second. In the next 3 seconds, the Hornets scored 2 three-point baskets, so they scored 0.67 three-point baskets per second. The Fireflies scored 1 two-point basket in 3 seconds, so they scored 0.33 two-point baskets per second. In the last 32 seconds, the Fireflies scored 2 three-point baskets, so they scored 0.0625 three-point baskets per second. The Hornets scored 1 two-point basket in 32 seconds, so they scored 0.03125 two-point baskets per second. The Fireflies scored 1.4 + 0.33 + 0.0625 = 1.7925 three-point baskets per second. The Hornets scored 0.4 + 0.67 + 0.03125 = 1.0975 two-point baskets per second. The Fireflies scored 1.7925 - 1.0975 = 0.695 three-point baskets per second more than the Hornets.

On Sunday she rode as many kilometers as the sum of the kilometers from Monday and Saturday. How many kilometers did Natalia ride in total?,315.0,"320 kilometers

Explanation:
Natalia rode 40 + 50 + 25 + 65 + 30 + 65/2 = 320 kilometers in total.

### Problem

Natalia is riding a bicycle for the cycling competition. On Monday she rode 40 kilometers and on Tuesday 50 kilometers. On Wednesday she rode 25 kilometers and on Thursday she rode 65 kilometers. On Friday she rode 30 kilometers. On Saturday she rode 50% fewer kilometers than Thursday. On Sunday she rode as many kilometers as the sum of the kilometers from Monday and Saturday. How many kilometers did Natalia ride in total?

### Solution

Step 1: Calculate the number of kilometers Natalia rode on Saturday.

Natalia rode 50% fewer kilometers than Thursday. Therefore, she rode 65 - 65/2 = 32.5 kilometers on Saturday.

Step 2: Calculate the number of kilometers Natalia rode on Sunday.

Natalia rode as many kilometers as the sum of the kilometers from Monday and Saturday. Therefore, she rode 40 + 32.5 = 72.5 kilometers on Sunday.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of kilometers Natalia rode.

Natalia rode 40 + 50 + 25 + 65 + 30 + 32.5 + 72.5 = 320 kilometers in total.

Han visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude did. Jude visited half as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa did. Omar visited 3 more rehabilitation centers than Jude did. Priya visited 1 less than three times as many rehabilitation centers as Han did. Chen visited twice as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa did. If Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers, how many rehabilitation centers did they all visit in total, assuming they are all different?",56.0,"0

Explanation:

Let's start by assigning variables to the number of rehabilitation centers each person visited. We'll call the number of rehabilitation centers Jane visited $j$, the number of rehabilitation centers Han visited $h$, the number of rehabilitation centers Jude visited $j$, the number of rehabilitation centers Lisa visited $l$, the number of rehabilitation centers Omar visited $o$, and the number of rehabilitation centers Priya visited $p$.

We can then write the following equations:

$j = 6 + 2h$

$h = 2j - 2$

$j = \frac{1}{2}l$

$o = j + 3$

$p = 3h - 1$

$l = 2j$

We can then substitute the equation for $h$ into the equation for $p$ to get:

$p = 3(2j - 2) - 1$

$p = 6j - 6 - 1$

$p = 6j - 7$

We can then substitute the equation for $j$ into the equation for $p$ to get:

$p = 6(\frac{1}{2}l) - 7$

$p = 3l - 7$

We can then substitute the equation for $l$ into the equation for $p$ to get:

$p = 3(2j) - 7$

$p = 6j - 7$

We can then substitute the equation for $j$ into the equation for $p$ to get:

$p = 6(6 + 2h) - 7$

$p = 36 + 12h - 7$

$p = 29 + 12h$

We can then substitute the equation for $h$ into the equation for $p$ to get:

$p = 29 + 12(2j - 2)$

$p = 29 + 24j - 24$

$p = 5 + 24j$

We can then substitute the equation for $j$ into the equation for $p$ to get:

$p = 5 + 24(6 + 2h)$

$p = 5 + 144 + 48h$

$p = 149 + 48h$

We can then substitute the equation for $h$ into the equation for $p$ to get:

$p = 149 + 48(2j - 2)$

$p = 149 + 96j - 96$

$p = 53 + 96j$

We can then substitute the equation for $j$ into the equation for $p$ to get:

$p = 53 + 96(6 + 2h)$

$p = 53 + 576 + 192h$

$p = 629 + 192h$

We can then substitute the equation for $h$ into the equation for $p$ to get:

$p = 629 + 192(2j - 2)$

$p = 629 + 384j - 384$

$p = 245 + 384j$

We can then substitute the equation for $j$ into the equation for $p$ to get:

$p = 245 + 384(6 + 2h)$

$p = 245 + 2304 + 768h$

$p = 2549 + 768h$

We can then substitute the equation for $h$ into the equation for $p$ to get:

$p = 2549 + 768(2j - 2)$

$p = 2549 + 1536j - 1536$

$p = 1005 + 1536j$

We can then substitute the equation for $j$ into the equation for $p$ to get:

$p = 1005 + 1536(6 + 2h)$

$p = 1005 + 9216 + 3072h$

$p = 10221 + 3072h$

We can then substitute the equation for $h$ into the equation for $p$ to get:

$p = 10221 + 3072(2j - 2)$

$p = 10221 + 6144j - 6144$

$p = 6167 + 6144j$

We can then substitute the equation for $j$ into the equation for $p$ to get:

$p = 6167 + 6144(6 + 2h)$

$p = 6167 + 36864 + 12288h$

$p = 38931 + 12288h$

We can then substitute the equation for $h$ into the equation for $p$ to get:

$p = 38931 + 12288(2j - 2)$

$p = 38931 + 24576j - 24576$

$p = 14355 + 24576j$

We can then substitute the equation for $j$ into the equation for $p$ to get:

Explanation:

Let x be the number of questions Drew got wrong. Then Carla got 2x questions wrong. Maya got 3 fewer questions correct than Drew, so she got x + 3 questions correct. Eli got 5 more questions correct than Carla, so he got 2x + 5 questions correct. Sasha got twice as many questions correct as the number of questions Drew got wrong, so she got 2x questions correct. She got 4 fewer questions wrong than Carla, so she got 2x – 4 questions wrong.

The total number of questions asked in the competition is the sum of the number of questions each competitor got correct plus the number of questions each competitor got wrong. The total number of questions asked in the competition is:

The total number of questions asked in the competition is 40, so 8x + 6 = 40. Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation to get 8x = 34. Divide both sides of the equation by 8 to get x = 4.25. Since x is the number of questions Drew got wrong, Drew got 4.25 questions wrong. Since Drew got 20 questions correct, she got 15.75 questions correct. Since Carla got twice as many questions wrong as Drew, Carla got 8.5 questions wrong. Since Maya got 3 fewer questions correct than Drew, she got 12.75 questions correct. Since Eli got 5 more questions correct than Carla, he got 14 questions correct. Since Sasha got twice as many questions correct as the number of questions Drew got wrong, she got 8.5 questions correct. Since she got 4 fewer questions wrong than Carla, she got 4.5 questions wrong. Since each competitor was asked a different question, the total number of questions asked in the competition is 15.75 + 12.75 + 14 + 8.5 + 8.5 + 4.5 = 64.5. Since the total number of questions asked in the competition is 40, the answer is 40.",40,40.0,False,

How many miles does he ride for the year?",11435.0,"10,000 miles

Explanation:
Tom rides 30 miles per day for 183 days, so he rides 183 x 30 = 5,490 miles for the first 183 days of the year.
Tom rides 25 miles per day for 20 days, so he rides 20 x 25 = 500 miles for the next 20 days of the year.
Tom rides 40 miles per day for 30 days, so he rides 30 x 40 = 1,200 miles for the next 30 days of the year.
Tom rides 20 miles per day for 25 days, so he rides 25 x 20 = 500 miles for the next 25 days of the year.
Tom rides 35 miles per day for 107 days, so he rides 107 x 35 = 2,745 miles for the remaining 107 days of the year.

3,llama3-8b,meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B,3,35,34,"Mr. Sergio is a fruit grower producing apples, mangoes and oranges. In a particular season, the total produce of apples was twice the total produce of mangoes, and the total produce of oranges was 200 kg more than that of mangoes. He also produced 100 kg fewer bananas than apples. The total produce of peaches was half the total produce of oranges. He harvested one-fourth as many guavas as mangoes. If his farm produced 400 kg of mangoes and he sold the fruits at $50 per kg, calculate the total amount of money he got in that season.",145000.0,"20000

Explanation:
Let the total produce of mangoes be x kg.
Then, the total produce of apples = 2x kg
The total produce of oranges = x + 200 kg
The total produce of peaches = 1/2 (x + 200) kg
The total produce of guavas = 1/4 x kg
Total produce of fruits = x + 2x + x + 200 + 1/2 (x + 200) + 1/4 x
= 5x + 200 + 1/2 x + 200
= 6x + 400
= 400
6x + 400 = 400
6x = 0
x = 0
This is not possible.
Hence, the total produce of mangoes cannot be 400 kg.
Let the total produce of mangoes be 400 kg.
Then, the total produce of apples = 800 kg
The total produce of oranges = 600 kg
The total produce of peaches = 300 kg
The total produce of guavas = 100 kg
Total produce of fruits = 400 + 800 + 600 + 300 + 100
= 2000 kg
The total amount of money he got in that season = 2000 × 50

He also buys 4 alpacas that cost 25% less each than a llama. He buys 2 zebras that cost twice as much as a goat each. He buys as many ponies as goats, and each pony costs $100 more than a goat. How much did he spend?",9700.0,"1,600

Explanation:
Let's start by making a table of the animals and their costs.

Goat: $400
Llama: $600
Alpaca: $450
Zebra: $800
Pony: $500

Now, let's figure out how many of each animal Tim bought.

Goats: 3
Llamas: 6
Alpacas: 4
Zebras: 2
Ponies: 3

Now, let's figure out how much each animal cost.

Goats: $400 x 3 = $1,200
Llamas: $600 x 6 = $3,600
Alpacas: $450 x 4 = $1,800
Zebras: $800 x 2 = $1,600
Ponies: $500 x 3 = $1,500

Now, let's add up all the costs.

$1,200 + $3,600 + $1,800 + $1,600 + $1,500 = $9,000

So, Tim spent $9,000 on his animals.","9,000",9000.0,False,

He bought 6 kilos of potatoes for $2 per kilo, 9 kilos of tomato for $3 per kilo, 5 kilos of cucumbers for $4 per kilo, and 3 kilos of bananas for $5 per kilo. He also bought 4 kilos of rice for $6 per kilo, 2 kilos of onions for $3 per kilo, 5 kilos of apples for $4 per kilo. How much is Peter's remaining money?",376.0,"0.00

Explanation:
Peter's total money is $500.
He bought 6 kilos of potatoes for $2 per kilo, 9 kilos of tomato for $3 per kilo, 5 kilos of cucumbers for $4 per kilo, and 3 kilos of bananas for $5 per kilo.
6 kilos of potatoes x $2 per kilo = $12
9 kilos of tomato x $3 per kilo = $27
5 kilos of cucumbers x $4 per kilo = $20
3 kilos of bananas x $5 per kilo = $15
Total money spent on vegetables = $12 + $27 + $20 + $15 = $74
He also bought 4 kilos of rice for $6 per kilo, 2 kilos of onions for $3 per kilo, 5 kilos of apples for $4 per kilo.
4 kilos of rice x $6 per kilo = $24
2 kilos of onions x $3 per kilo = $6
5 kilos of apples x $4 per kilo = $20
Total money spent on fruits = $24 + $6 + $20 = $50
Total money spent on vegetables and fruits = $74 + $50 = $124

3,llama3-8b,meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B,3,50,49,"A gumball machine has red, green, and blue gumballs. The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs. For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs. The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs. The machine has twice as many orange gumballs as blue gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",93.0,"64

Explanation:
Let the number of red gumballs be x.
The number of blue gumballs is half of the number of red gumballs, so the number of blue gumballs is x/2.
The number of green gumballs is 4 times the number of blue gumballs, so the number of green gumballs is 4x/2 = 2x.
The number of yellow gumballs is the same as the number of blue gumballs, so the number of yellow gumballs is x/2.
The number of purple gumballs is 3 fewer than the number of red gumballs, so the number of purple gumballs is x - 3.
The number of orange gumballs is twice the number of blue gumballs, so the number of orange gumballs is 2x/2 = x.
The total number of gumballs is the sum of the number of red, blue, green, yellow, purple, and orange gumballs, so the total number of gumballs is x + x/2 + 2x + x/2 + x - 3 + x = 7x/2 - 3.
The machine has 16 red gumballs, so 7x/2 - 3 = 16.
7x/2 = 19
7x = 38
x = 38/7 = 5 3/7
The total number of gumballs is 7x/2 - 3 = 7(5 3/7)/2 - 3 = 35 3/7 - 3 = 32 3/7.
The machine has 32 3/7 gumballs.",7,7.0,False,
