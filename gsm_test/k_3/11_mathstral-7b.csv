How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle, Alice, Bob and David have together if David has 20 sheep?",8180.0," Let's start by finding out how many sheep each person has, starting from David and working our way up.

1. David has 20 sheep.
2. Bob has 3 times as many sheep as David, so Bob has 3 * 20 = 60 sheep.
3. Alice has 5 times as many sheep as Bob, so Alice has 5 * 60 = 300 sheep.
4. Seattle has 2 times as many sheep as Alice, so Seattle has 2 * 300 = 600 sheep.
5. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so Charleston has 4 * 600 = 2400 sheep.
6. Toulouse has 2 times as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 2 * 2400 = 4800 sheep.

How many shells do they have altogether?",40.0," Let's calculate the number of shells each person found and then add them to the initial 2 shells they already had in their collection.

Ed found:
7 limpet shells + 2 oyster shells + 4 conch shells = 7 + 2 + 4 = 13 shells

Jacob found 2 more shells than Ed, so:
13 shells (Ed's total) + 2 shells = 15 shells

Maya found 12 fewer than Jacob, so:
15 shells (Jacob's total) - 12 shells = 3 shells

Liam found 2 more than Maya, so:
3 shells (Maya's total) + 2 shells = 5 shells

Noah found 3 fewer than Liam, so:
5 shells (Liam's total) - 3 shells = 2 shells

Now, let's add the shells each person found to the initial 2 shells they already had:

Ed's total: 13 shells (found) + 2 shells (initial) = 15 shells
Jacob's total: 15 shells (found) + 2 shells (initial) = 17 shells
Maya's total: 3 shells (found) + 2 shells (initial) = 5 shells
Liam's total: 5 shells (found) + 2 shells (initial) = 7 shells

Cost of 10 drinks at $6 each = 10 * $6 = $60

For himself:
6 drinks at $6 each = 6 * $6 = $36

Now, let's calculate the cost of the food he ordered:
Fried chicken = $14
2 nachos at $8.0 each = 2 * $8.0 = $16
1 bucket of wings at $12.0 each = 1 * $12.0 = $12
7 bottles of wine at $25.0 each = 7 * $25.0 = $175

How much, in dollars, will the store need to pay to fill the displays?",856.0," To calculate the total cost to fill the displays, we need to determine how many more items are needed for each display and then multiply that by the cost per item.

For the necklace stand:
12 (total capacity) - 5 (currently held) = 7 necklaces needed
7 necklaces * $4 per necklace = $28

For the ring display:
30 (total capacity) - 18 (currently held) = 12 rings needed
12 rings * $10 per ring = $120

For the bracelet display:
15 (total capacity) - 8 (currently held) = 7 bracelets needed
7 bracelets * $5 per bracelet = $35

For the watch display:
20 (total capacity) - 7 (currently held) = 13 watchs needed
13 watchs * $25 per watch = $325

For the earring display:
50 (total capacity) - 14 (currently held) = 36 earrings needed
36 earrings * $8 per earring = $288

For the tiara display:
5 (total capacity) - 4 (currently held) = 1 tiara needed
1 tiara * $60 per tiara = $60

Now, we add up the costs for each display to get the total cost:
$28 (necklaces) + $120 (rings) + $35 (bracelets) + $325 (watches) + $288 (earrings) + $60 (tiaras) = $856

The store will need to pay $856 to fill the displays.

If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?",320.0," Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles.

2. Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2 * 30 = 60 red marbles.

3. Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary, so Anie collected 60 + 20 = 80 red marbles.

4. Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, so Anie collected 2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles.

5. Tom collected three times as many red marbles as Mary, so Tom collected 3 * 60 = 180 red marbles.

6. Tom collected 5 fewer blue marbles than Jenny, so Tom collected 25 - 5 = 20 blue marbles.

7. Sara collected 10 fewer red marbles than Anie, so Sara collected 80 - 10 = 70 red marbles.

8. Sara collected five times as many blue marbles as Mary, so Sara collected 5 * 25 = 125 blue marbles.

9. Leo collected three times as many red marbles as Jenny, so Leo collected 3 * 30 = 90 red marbles.

10. Leo collected three times as many blue marbles as Jenny, so Leo collected 3 * 25 = 75 blue marbles.

Now, let's add up the blue marbles collected by each friend:

- Jenny: 25 blue marbles
- Mary: 25 blue marbles (since Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, and Anie collected 50, Mary would have collected 50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles)
- Anie: 50 blue marbles
- Tom: 20 blue marbles
- Sara: 125 blue marbles
- Leo: 75 blue marbles

Total blue marbles collected by the friends together = 25 (Jenny) + 25 (Mary) + 50 (Anie) + 20 (Tom) + 125 (Sara) + 75 (Leo) = 300 blue marbles.

She adds:
- 6 cans of Mountain Dew at 12 oz each, which is 6 * 12 = 72 oz
- 28 oz of ice
- 40 oz of fruit juice
- 5 cans of ginger ale at 8 oz each, which is 5 * 8 = 40 oz
- 2 bottles of orange soda at 15 oz each, which is 2 * 15 = 30 oz
- 20 oz of cranberry juice

Now, let's add all these volumes together to get the total volume of the punch:

Total volume = 72 oz (Mountain Dew) + 28 oz (ice) + 40 oz (fruit juice) + 40 oz (ginger ale) + 30 oz (orange soda) + 20 oz (cranberry juice)
Total volume = 210 oz

Now, to find out how many 10 oz servings of punch Carrie has, we divide the total volume by the size of one serving:

If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",396.0," Let's start by calculating the number of treats and pieces of bread each person brings based on the information provided.

Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread. Since Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, we can calculate the number of treats Wanda brings:
Wanda's treats = 90 pieces of bread / 3 = 30 treats

Now, let's calculate the number of treats and pieces of bread for the other individuals:

Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats. Since Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane, we can find the number of treats Jane brings:
Jane's treats = Wanda's treats * 2 = 30 treats * 2 = 60 treats

Now, we can find the number of pieces of bread Jane brings:
Jane's bread = 75% of Jane's treats = 0.75 * 60 treats = 45 pieces of bread

Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane:
Carlos's treats = Jane's treats / 3 = 60 treats / 3 = 20 treats

Carlos brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats:
Carlos's bread = 2 * Carlos's treats = 2 * 20 treats = 40 pieces of bread

Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda:
Mia's treats = Wanda's treats - 10 = 30 treats - 10 = 20 treats

Mia brings half as many pieces of bread as treats:
Mia's bread = 1/2 * Mia's treats = 1/2 * 20 treats = 10 pieces of bread

Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda:
Omar's treats = 1.5 * Wanda's treats = 1.5 * 30 treats = 45 treats

Omar brings four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats:
Omar's bread = 4/5 * Omar's treats = 4/5 * 45 treats = 36 pieces of bread

Now, let's add up all the pieces of bread and treats:

Total bread = Wanda's bread + Jane's bread + Carlos's bread + Mia's bread + Omar's bread
Total bread = 90 + 45 + 40 + 10 + 36
Total bread = 221 pieces of bread

Total treats = Wanda's treats + Jane's treats + Carlos's treats + Mia's treats + Omar's treats
Total treats = 30 + 60 + 20 + 20 + 45
Total treats = 175 treats

The total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo is:

If Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers, how many rehabilitation centers did they all visit in total, assuming they are all different?",56.0," Let's solve this step by step:

1. Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers.
2. Jude visited half as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa did, so Jude visited 6 / 2 = 3 rehabilitation centers.
3. Han visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude did, so Han visited (2 * 3) - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4 rehabilitation centers.
4. Jane visited 6 more than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Han did, so Jane visited (2 * 4) + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14 rehabilitation centers.
5. Omar visited 3 more rehabilitation centers than Jude did, so Omar visited 3 + 3 = 6 rehabilitation centers.

If Marcus walks at 6 miles per hour, how much time does he spend with his dog total?",90.0," First, let's calculate the time Marcus spends on each activity:

1. Bath: 20 minutes
2. Blow-drying: Half as long as the bath, so 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes
3. Brushing: 8 minutes
4. Nail trimming: Half as long as brushing, so 8 minutes / 2 = 4 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time spent driving to the trailhead:

5. Driving: 9 miles at 30 miles per hour. To find the time, we use the formula Time = Distance / Speed. So, Time = 9 miles / 30 miles per hour = 0.3 hours. To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour), so 0.3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 18 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time spent walking the trail:

6. Walking: 3 miles at 6 miles per hour. Using the same formula, Time = Distance / Speed, we get Time = 3 miles / 6 miles per hour = 0.5 hours. Converting to minutes, 0.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes.

Now, let's add up all the times:

Bath: 20 minutes
Blow-drying: 10 minutes
Brushing: 8 minutes
Nail trimming: 4 minutes
Driving: 18 minutes
Walking: 30 minutes

Total time = 20 + 10 + 8 + 4 + 18 + 30 = 80 minutes

How many tarantulas does he need to see to meet his goal?",120.0," First, let's calculate the total number of legs Borgnine has seen so far.

Chimps have 4 legs each, so 12 chimps have 12 * 4 = 48 legs.
Lions have 4 legs each, so 8 lions have 8 * 4 = 32 legs.
Lizards have 4 legs each, so 5 lizards have 5 * 4 = 20 legs.
Penguins have 2 legs each, so 8 penguins have 8 * 2 = 16 legs.
Elephants have 4 legs each, so 6 elephants have 6 * 4 = 24 legs.
Parrots have 2 legs each, so 12 parrots have 12 * 2 = 24 legs.

Now, let's add up all the legs Borgnine has seen:

48 (chimp legs) + 32 (lion legs) + 20 (lizard legs) + 16 (penguin legs) + 24 (elephant legs) + 24 (parrot legs) = 164 legs.

Borgnine wants to see a total of 1100 legs. So, the number of legs he still needs to see is:

1100 (total desired legs) - 164 (legs already seen) = 936 legs.

Tarantulas have 8 legs each. To find out how many tarantulas Borgnine needs to see to meet his goal, we divide the remaining number of legs by the number of legs a tarantula has:

1. Pencil: Given as 12 centimeters.

2. Pen: The pen is shorter than the pencil by 2 centimeters, so the pen is 12 - 2 = 10 centimeters long.

3. Rubber: The pen is longer than the rubber by 3 centimeters, so the rubber is 10 - 3 = 7 centimeters long.

4. Marker: The marker is 1 centimeter longer than the pencil, so the marker is 12 + 1 = 13 centimeters long.

5. Crayon: The crayon is 2 centimeters shorter than the rubber, so the crayon is 7 - 2 = 5 centimeters long.

3x + 3 = 96
3x = 93
x = 31

So, the youngest of the three oldest brothers is 31 years old.

Now, let's find the ages of the younger brothers:
- Liam is 1 year younger than the youngest of the three oldest brothers, so he is 31 - 1 = 30 years old.
- Noah is 1 year younger than Liam, so he is 30 - 1 = 29 years old.

Apples: Last night she had 3 apples. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, so that's 3 + 4 = 7 apples.

Bananas: Last night she had 1 banana. Today she is planning to have 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, so that's 1 * 10 = 10 bananas.

Oranges: Last night she had 4 oranges. Today she is planning to have twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today, so that's 7 * 2 = 14 oranges.

Pears: Last night she had 2 pears. Today she is planning to have 2 fewer pears than the number of apples she'll have today, so that's 7 - 2 = 5 pears.

Peaches: Last night she had 3 peaches. Today she is planning to have three times as many peaches as she ate last night, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 peaches.

Grapes: Last night she had 8 grapes. Today she is planning to have half as many grapes as the oranges she'll have today, so that's 14 / 2 = 7 grapes.

Now, let's add up all the fruits she had last night and all the fruits she is planning to have today:

There is also a monthly cost of $1000 per person. There is also an annual maintenance fee of $600 per person. Each person also pays $50 per month for gym access. The family buys 2 guest passes each month at $30 each. John agrees to pay half the total cost for the whole family. How much does John pay for the first year?,34760.0," First, let's calculate the total cost for the whole family for the first year.

The initial joining fee for the family is:
4 people * $4000 = $16000

The monthly cost for the family is:
4 people * $1000 = $4000 per month
For 12 months, this is:
$4000 * 12 = $48000

The annual maintenance fee for the family is:
4 people * $600 = $2400 per year

The monthly gym access cost for the family is:
4 people * $50 = $200 per month
For 12 months, this is:
$200 * 12 = $2400

The cost for guest passes for the family each month is:
2 guest passes * $30 = $60 per month
For 12 months, this is:
$60 * 12 = $720

Now, let's add all these costs to find the total cost for the first year:
$16000 (joining fee) + $48000 (monthly cost) + $2400 (maintenance fee) + $2400 (gym access) + $720 (guest passes) = $71520

John agrees to pay half of this total cost, so:
$71520 / 2 = $35760

- Lions: 100
- Snakes: 100 / 2 = 50
- Giraffes: 50 - 10 = 40
- Zebras: 2 * 40 = 80
- Elephants: 50 - 5 = 45
- Monkeys: 3 * 40 = 120

- Snakes: 50 * 3 = 150
- Giraffes: 40 + 20 = 60
- Zebras: 200 / 2 = 100

How much did he spend?",9700.0," First, let's calculate the cost of each type of animal:

1. Goats: Tim buys 3 goats for $400 each.
   Total cost for goats = 3 * $400 = $1200

2. Llamas: Tim gets twice as many llamas as goats, so he gets 3 * 2 = 6 llamas. Each llama costs 50% more than a goat. The cost of a goat is $400, so the cost of a llama is $400 + (50% of $400) = $400 + $200 = $600.
   Total cost for llamas = 6 * $600 = $3600

3. Alpacas: Tim buys 4 alpacas that cost 25% less each than a llama. The cost of a llama is $600, so the cost of an alpaca is $600 - (25% of $600) = $600 - $150 = $450.
   Total cost for alpacas = 4 * $450 = $1800

4. Zebras: Tim buys 2 zebras that cost twice as much as a goat each. The cost of a goat is $400, so the cost of a zebra is 2 * $400 = $800.
   Total cost for zebras = 2 * $800 = $1600

5. Ponies: Tim buys as many ponies as goats, so he buys 3 ponies. Each pony costs $100 more than a goat. The cost of a goat is $400, so the cost of a pony is $400 + $100 = $500.
   Total cost for ponies = 3 * $500 = $1500

Now, let's add up the total cost for all the animals:

Total cost = Cost for goats + Cost for llamas + Cost for alpacas + Cost for zebras + Cost for ponies
Total cost = $1200 + $3600 + $1800 + $1600 + $1500

1. With one sail:
Speed = 25 knots
Time = 4 hours
Distance in nautical miles = Speed × Time = 25 knots × 4 hours = 100 nautical miles

2. With two sails:
Speed = 50 knots
Time = 4 hours
Distance in nautical miles = Speed × Time = 50 knots × 4 hours = 200 nautical miles

3. With three sails:
Speed = 60 knots
Time = 1 hour
Distance in nautical miles = Speed × Time = 60 knots × 1 hour = 60 nautical miles

4. With four sails:
Speed = 70 knots
Time = 2 hours
Distance in nautical miles = Speed × Time = 70 knots × 2 hours = 140 nautical miles

5. With one reefed sail:
Speed = 15 knots
Time = 4 hours
Distance in nautical miles = Speed × Time = 15 knots × 4 hours = 60 nautical miles

Now, we convert the total distance from nautical miles to land miles:
Total distance in nautical miles = 100 + 200 + 60 + 140 + 60 = 560 nautical miles

Conversion factor: 1 nautical mile = 1.15 land miles

Total distance in land miles = Total distance in nautical miles × Conversion factor

His company has 5 sectors with different t-shirt colors. Two sectors use white t-shirts and black t-shirts. He paid $20 for white men's t-shirts and $18 for black men's t-shirts. He paid $22 for blue men's t-shirts. He paid $21 for red men's t-shirts. He paid $19 for green men's t-shirts. Each sector has 10 men and 10 women, so there are 100 employees in total. How much did he spend total on buying t-shirts?",1750.0," To calculate the total amount Juan spent on buying t-shirts for his employees, we need to consider the cost of t-shirts for both men and women in each color, and then sum up the costs for all sectors.

For men's t-shirts:
- White: $20
- Black: $18
- Blue: $22
- Red: $21
- Green: $19

For women's t-shirts, which are $5 cheaper than men's t-shirts of the same color:
- White: $20 - $5 = $15
- Black: $18 - $5 = $13
- Blue: $22 - $5 = $17
- Red: $21 - $5 = $16
- Green: $19 - $5 = $14

Each sector has 10 men and 10 women, so for each color, Juan buys 10 men's and 10 women's t-shirts.

For white t-shirts:
- Men: 10 * $20 = $200
- Women: 10 * $15 = $150
- Total for white: $200 + $150 = $350

For black t-shirts:
- Men: 10 * $18 = $180
- Women: 10 * $13 = $130
- Total for black: $180 + $130 = $310

For blue t-shirts:
- Men: 10 * $22 = $220
- Women: 10 * $17 = $170
- Total for blue: $220 + $170 = $390

For red t-shirts:
- Men: 10 * $21 = $210
- Women: 10 * $16 = $160
- Total for red: $210 + $160 = $370

For green t-shirts:
- Men: 10 * $19 = $190
- Women: 10 * $14 = $140
- Total for green: $190 + $140 = $330

Now, we add up the total cost for all colors:
- Total cost = $350 (white) + $310 (black) + $390 (blue) + $370 (red) + $330 (green)
- Total cost = $1750

Therefore, Juan spent a total of $\boxed{1750}$ on buying t-shirts for his employees.",1750,1750.0,True,

Tony has 3 times as many fish in his aquarium as Billy does. Billy has 10 fish. Nina has 2 fewer fish in her aquarium than Billy does. Omar has half as many fish in his aquarium as Bobby has. Priya has 4 times as many fish in her aquarium as Nina has. How many fish do all the people mentioned have put together?,220.0," Let's solve this step by step:

1. Billy has 10 fish.
2. Tony has 3 times as many fish as Billy, so Tony has 3 * 10 = 30 fish.
3. Sarah has 5 more fish than Tony, so Sarah has 30 + 5 = 35 fish.
4. Bobby has twice as many fish as Sarah, so Bobby has 2 * 35 = 70 fish.
5. Nina has 2 fewer fish than Billy, so Nina has 10 - 2 = 8 fish.
6. Priya has 4 times as many fish as Nina, so Priya has 4 * 8 = 32 fish.
7. Omar has half as many fish as Bobby, so Omar has 70 / 2 = 35 fish.

Now, let's add up all the fish:

Billy's fish + Tony's fish + Sarah's fish + Bobby's fish + Nina's fish + Priya's fish + Omar's fish
= 10 + 30 + 35 + 70 + 8 + 32 + 35

Avery has half as many stuffed animals as Kenley. Jordan has 3 times as many stuffed animals as McKenna. How many stuffed animals do all the people mentioned have in all?,374.0," Let's calculate the number of stuffed animals each person has:

1. McKenna has 34 stuffed animals.

2. Kenley has twice as many as McKenna, so Kenley has 2 * 34 = 68 stuffed animals.

3. Tenly has 5 more than Kenley, so Tenly has 68 + 5 = 73 stuffed animals.

4. Riley has 10 fewer stuffed animals than Tenly, so Riley has 73 - 10 = 63 stuffed animals.

5. Avery has half as many stuffed animals as Kenley, so Avery has 68 / 2 = 34 stuffed animals.

6. Jordan has 3 times as many stuffed animals as McKenna, so Jordan has 3 * 34 = 102 stuffed animals.

Now, let's add up all the stuffed animals:

McKenna + Kenley + Tenly + Riley + Avery + Jordan
= 34 + 68 + 73 + 63 + 34 + 102
= 374 stuffed animals in total.

Her friends are Jessica, Tori, Lily, Patrice, Ava, Monique, and Ben. If each jelly bracelet costs $2, what is the total she will spend in dollars?",70.0," First, we need to find the number of letters in each friend's name:

Jessica has 7 letters.
Tori has 4 letters.
Lily has 4 letters.
Patrice has 7 letters.
Ava has 3 letters.
Monique has 7 letters.
Ben has 3 letters.

Next, we add up the number of letters for all friends:

7 (Jessica) + 4 (Tori) + 4 (Lily) + 7 (Patrice) + 3 (Ava) + 7 (Monique) + 3 (Ben) = 37 letters

Since Robin wants to buy one bracelet for each letter, she will buy 37 bracelets.

Finally, we multiply the number of bracelets by the cost per bracelet to find the total cost:

37 bracelets * $2/bracelet = $74

So, Robin will spend \boxed{74} dollars on jelly bracelets.",74,74.0,False,

He also has 10 crickets. What is the total number of legs in his entire collection?,250.0," To find the total number of legs in Monroe's collection, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of insect and then sum them up.

Spiders have 8 legs each, so 8 spiders have 8 * 8 = 64 legs.
Ants have 6 legs each, so 12 ants have 12 * 6 = 72 legs.
Beetles have 6 legs each, so 5 beetles have 5 * 6 = 30 legs.
Scorpions have 8 legs each, so 3 scorpions have 3 * 8 = 24 legs.
Crickets have 6 legs each, so 10 crickets have 10 * 6 = 60 legs.

Now, we add up all the legs:
64 (spiders) + 72 (ants) + 30 (beetles) + 24 (scorpions) + 60 (crickets) = 250 legs.

So, the total number of legs in Monroe's collection is $\boxed{250}$ .",250,250.0,True,

The machine has twice as many orange gumballs as blue gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",93.0," Let's calculate the number of each color of gumballs based on the information given:

1. Red gumballs: 16 (given)
2. Blue gumballs: Half as many as red gumballs, so 16 / 2 = 8
3. Green gumballs: 4 times as many as blue gumballs, so 8 * 4 = 32
4. Yellow gumballs: As many as blue gumballs, so 8
5. Purple gumballs: 3 fewer than red gumballs, so 16 - 3 = 13
6. Orange gumballs: Twice as many as blue gumballs, so 8 * 2 = 16

Now, let's add them all up to find the total number of gumballs in the machine:

16 (red) + 8 (blue) + 32 (green) + 8 (yellow) + 13 (purple) + 16 (orange) = 93

So, the machine has a total of 93 gumballs.
