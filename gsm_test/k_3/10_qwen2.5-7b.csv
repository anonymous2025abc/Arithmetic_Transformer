1. **David's Sheep:**
   David has 20 sheep.
   \[
   D = 20
   \]

2. **Bob's Sheep:**
   Bob has 3 times as many sheep as David.

How many square feet combined are in all their gardens?",750.0,"To determine the total square footage of all the gardens, we need to calculate the area of each garden and then sum the areas for all the gardens being worked on by Mancino, Marquita, Luis, Tasha, and Nia.

First, let's calculate the area of each type of garden:

1. **Mancino's gardens:**
   - Each garden measures 16 feet by 5 feet.
   - Area of one garden: \( 16 \times 5 = 80 \) square feet.
   - Mancino has 3 gardens.
   - Total area for Mancino's gardens: \( 3 \times 80 = 240 \) square feet.

2. **Marquita's gardens:**
   - Each garden measures 8 feet by 4 feet.
   - Area of one garden: \( 8 \times 4 = 32 \) square feet.
   - Marquita has 2 gardens.
   - Total area for Marquita's gardens: \( 2 \times 32 = 64 \) square feet.

3. **Luis's gardens:**
   - Each garden measures 10 feet by 6 feet.
   - Area of one garden: \( 10 \times 6 = 60 \) square feet.
   - Luis has 4 gardens.
   - Total area for Luis's gardens: \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) square feet.

4. **Tasha's garden:**
   - The garden measures 12 feet by 9 feet.
   - Area of one garden: \( 12 \times 9 = 108 \) square feet.
   - Tasha has 1 garden.
   - Total area for Tasha's garden: \( 1 \times 108 = 108 \) square feet.

5. **Nia's gardens:**
   - Each garden measures 7 feet by 7 feet.
   - Area of one garden: \( 7 \times 7 = 49 \) square feet.
   - Nia has 2 gardens.
   - Total area for Nia's gardens: \( 2 \times 49 = 98 \) square feet.

Next, we sum the total areas of all the gardens:

\[
240 + 64 + 240 + 108 + 98

Let's add these step by step:

\[
240 + 64 = 304

How many 10 oz servings of punch does Carrie have?",23.0,"To determine how many 10 oz servings of punch Carrie has, we need to calculate the total volume of the punch by adding up the volumes of all the ingredients she uses. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Mountain Dew**: Carrie adds 6 cans of Mountain Dew, and each can is 12 oz.
   \[
   6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ oz}
   \]

2. **Ice**: Carrie adds 28 oz of ice.

Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda and half as many pieces of bread as treats. Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda and four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats. If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",396.0,"To determine the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo, we need to calculate the number of treats and pieces of bread each person brought based on the given relationships and then sum them up.

First, let's find out how many treats Wanda brought. We know that Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread and three times as many pieces of bread as treats. Let \( T_W \) be the number of treats Wanda brought. Then:
\[ 3T_W = 90 \]
\[ T_W = \frac{90}{3} = 30 \]

Now, we can calculate the number of treats and pieces of bread each person brought:

1. **Jane**: Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats. Let \( T_J \) be the number of treats Jane brought. Then:
\[ T_J = \frac{2}{3} T_W = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \]
\[ B_J = 0.75 T_J = 0.75 \times 20 = 15 \]

2. **Wanda**: Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread and 30 treats. So:
\[ T_W = 30 \]
\[ B_W = 90 \]

3. **Carlos**: Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane and twice as many pieces of bread as treats. So:
\[ T_C = \frac{1}{3} T_J = \frac{1}{3} \times 20 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \]
\[ B_C = 2 T_C = 2 \times \frac{20}{3} = \frac{40}{3} \approx 13.33 \]

4. **Mia**: Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda and half as many pieces of bread as treats. So:
\[ T_M = T_W - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]
\[ B_M = \frac{1}{2} T_M = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

5. **Omar**: Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda and four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats. So:
\[ T_O = 1.5 T_W = 1.5 \times 30 = 45 \]
\[ B_O = \frac{4}{5} T_O = \frac{4}{5} \times 45 = 36 \]

Now, we sum up the total number of treats and pieces of bread brought by everyone:
\[ T_{\text{total}} = T_J + T_W + T_C + T_M + T_O = 20 + 30 + \frac{20}{3} + 20 + 45 = 135 + \frac{20}{3} = \frac{405}{3} + \frac{20}{3} = \frac{425}{3} \approx 141.67 \]
\[ B_{\text{total}} = B_J + B_W + B_C + B_M + B_O = 15 + 90 + \frac{40}{3} + 10 + 36 = 151 + \frac{40}{3} = \frac{453}{3} + \frac{40}{3} = \frac{493}{3} \approx 164.33 \]

Finally, the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo is:
\[ T_{\text{total}} + B_{\text{total}} = \frac{425}{3} + \frac{493}{3} = \frac{918}{3} = 306 \]

How old is the youngest brother?,28.0,"To determine the age of the youngest brother, we start by defining the ages of the three oldest brothers. Let the age of the youngest brother be \( x \). Since the ages are consecutive integers, the age of the middle brother is \( x+1 \) and the age of the oldest brother is \( x+2 \).

The sum of their ages is given as 96. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 96

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[
3x + 3 = 96

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[
3x = 93

First, let's calculate the number of each type of fruit Kannon plans to eat today:

1. **Apples**: Last night Kannon had 3 apples. Today she plans to have 4 more apples than last night.
   \[
   3 + 4 = 7
   \]
   So, today she plans to have 7 apples.

2. **Bananas**: Last night Kannon had 1 banana. Today she plans to have 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night.
   \[
   1 \times 10 = 10
   \]
   So, today she plans to have 10 bananas.

3. **Oranges**: Last night Kannon had 4 oranges. Today she plans to have twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today.
   \[
   7 \times 2 = 14
   \]
   So, today she plans to have 14 oranges.

4. **Pears**: Last night Kannon had 2 pears. Today she plans to have 2 fewer pears than the number of apples she'll have today.
   \[
   7 - 2 = 5
   \]
   So, today she plans to have 5 pears.

5. **Peaches**: Last night Kannon had 3 peaches. Today she plans to have three times as many peaches as she ate last night.
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9
   \]
   So, today she plans to have 9 peaches.

6. **Grapes**: Last night Kannon had 8 grapes. Today she plans to have half as many grapes as the oranges she'll have today.
   \[
   \frac{14}{2} = 7
   \]
   So, today she plans to have 7 grapes.

Now, let's sum up all the fruits from both meals:

- **Apples**: \(3 + 7 = 10\)
- **Bananas**: \(1 + 10 = 11\)
- **Oranges**: \(4 + 14 = 18\)
- **Pears**: \(2 + 5 = 7\)

The family buys 2 guest passes each month at $30 each. John agrees to pay half the total cost for the whole family. How much does John pay for the first year?,34760.0,"To determine how much John pays for the first year, we need to calculate the total cost for the family and then find out how much John pays, which is half of the total cost.

First, let's calculate the initial joining fee for the family:
\[

One more friend, Nina, ordered the same as Mell, but she also bought 2 bowls of ice cream. Two more friends each ordered 1 cup of coffee and 2 bowls of ice cream. Another friend, Omar, ordered 3 cups of coffee and 1 piece of cake. How much money did Mell and her friends need to pay at the cafeteria?",111.0,"To determine the total amount of money Mell and her friends needed to pay at the cafeteria, we will calculate the cost of each person's order and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost of Mell's order:
- Mell ordered 2 cups of coffee and 1 piece of cake.
- The cost of one cup of coffee is $4, so the cost of 2 cups is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.
- The cost of one piece of cake is $7.
- Therefore, the total cost of Mell's order is \(8 + 7 = 15\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of each of Mell's two friends' orders:
- Each friend ordered 2 cups of coffee, 1 piece of cake, and 1 bowl of ice cream.
- The cost of 2 cups of coffee is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.
- The cost of one piece of cake is $7.
- The cost of one bowl of ice cream is $3.
- Therefore, the total cost of each friend's order is \(8 + 7 + 3 = 18\) dollars.
- Since there are two friends, the total cost for both friends is \(2 \times 18 = 36\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the cost of Nina's order:
- Nina ordered the same as Mell, but she also bought 2 bowls of ice cream.
- The cost of 2 cups of coffee is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.
- The cost of one piece of cake is $7.
- The cost of 2 bowls of ice cream is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of Nina's order is \(8 + 7 + 6 = 21\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the cost of each of the two friends who ordered 1 cup of coffee and 2 bowls of ice cream:
- Each friend ordered 1 cup of coffee and 2 bowls of ice cream.
- The cost of one cup of coffee is $4.
- The cost of 2 bowls of ice cream is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of each friend's order is \(4 + 6 = 10\) dollars.
- Since there are two friends, the total cost for both friends is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the cost of Omar's order:
- Omar ordered 3 cups of coffee and 1 piece of cake.
- The cost of 3 cups of coffee is \(3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars.
- The cost of one piece of cake is $7.
- Therefore, the total cost of Omar's order is \(12 + 7 = 19\) dollars.

Finally, we sum the costs of all the orders:
- Mell's order: $15
- Two friends' orders: $36
- Nina's order: $21
- Two friends' orders: $20
- Omar's order: $19
- Therefore, the total cost is \(15 + 36 + 21 + 20 + 19 = 111\) dollars.

He needs to know how many pieces to cut the lasagna into to serve it. Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Another friend, Nora, is picky and will only eat one-third of what Manny eats, and Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. Another friend, Ben, will eat the same amount of lasagna as Kai. Another friend, Tina, loves lasagna and will eat 3 pieces. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",12.0,"To determine how many pieces Manny should cut his lasagna into, we need to calculate the amount of lasagna each person will eat and then sum these amounts.

1. **Manny**: Manny will eat 1 piece.
2. **Aaron**: Aaron will eat 0 pieces.
3. **Kai**: Kai will eat twice as much as Manny, so Kai will eat \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pieces.
4. **Raphael**: Raphael will eat half the amount Manny does, so Raphael will eat \(\frac{1}{2} \times 1 = 0.5\) pieces.
5. **Lisa**: Lisa will eat 2 pieces plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Since Raphael eats 0.5 pieces, he has \(0.5\) pieces left. Therefore, Lisa will eat \(2 + 0.5 = 2.5\) pieces.
6. **Nora**: Nora will eat one-third of what Manny eats, so Nora will eat \(\frac{1}{3} \times 1 = \frac{1}{3}\) pieces. Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece, so Lisa will eat \(2.5 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{7.5}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{6.5}{3} = \frac{13}{6}\) pieces.
7. **Ben**: Ben will eat the same amount of lasagna as Kai, so Ben will eat 2 pieces.
8. **Tina**: Tina will eat 3 pieces.

Now, we sum up the pieces of lasagna each person will eat:
\[
1 + 0 + 2 + 0.5 + 2.5 + \frac{13}{6} + 2 + 3
\]

First, we convert all the numbers to fractions with a common denominator. The common denominator for 1, 0.5, 2.5, and \(\frac{13}{6}\) is 6:
\[
1 = \frac{6}{6}, \quad 0.5 = \frac{3}{6}, \quad 2 = \frac{12}{6}, \quad 2.5 = \frac{15}{6}
\]

So the sum becomes:
\[
\frac{6}{6} + \frac{0}{6} + \frac{12}{6} + \frac{3}{6} + \frac{15}{6} + \frac{13}{6} + \frac{12}{6} + \frac{18}{6}
\]

Combining the fractions, we get:
\[
\frac{6 + 0 + 12 + 3 + 15 + 13 + 12 + 18}{6} = \frac{89}{6}
\]

To convert \(\frac{89}{6}\) to a mixed number, we perform the division:
\[
89 \div 6 = 14 \text{ remainder } 5
\]
So, \(\frac{89}{6} = 14 \frac{5}{6}\).

Since Manny cannot cut the lasagna into a fraction of a piece, he needs to cut it into at least 15 pieces. Therefore, the number of pieces Manny should cut his lasagna into is:

He paid $22 for blue men's t-shirts. He paid $21 for red men's t-shirts. He paid $19 for green men's t-shirts. Each sector has 10 men and 10 women, so there are 100 employees in total. How much did he spend total on buying t-shirts?",1750.0,"To determine the total amount Juan spent on buying t-shirts, we need to calculate the cost for each color of t-shirt and then sum these costs.

First, let's find the cost of each type of t-shirt for men and women:
- White men's t-shirt: $20
- Black men's t-shirt: $18
- Blue men's t-shirt: $22
- Red men's t-shirt: $21
- Green men's t-shirt: $19

Since women's t-shirts are $5 cheaper than men's t-shirts of the same color, we can calculate the cost for women's t-shirts as follows:
- White women's t-shirt: $20 - $5 = $15
- Black women's t-shirt: $18 - $5 = $13
- Blue women's t-shirt: $22 - $5 = $17
- Red women's t-shirt: $21 - $5 = $16
- Green women's t-shirt: $19 - $5 = $14

Next, we calculate the total cost for each color of t-shirt for both men and women. Since each sector has 10 men and 10 women, the total number of men and women for each color is 100/5 = 20 men and 20 women.

- Total cost for white t-shirts: $20 * 20 (men) + $15 * 20 (women) = $400 + $300 = $700
- Total cost for black t-shirts: $18 * 20 (men) + $13 * 20 (women) = $360 + $260 = $620
- Total cost for blue t-shirts: $22 * 20 (men) + $17 * 20 (women) = $440 + $340 = $780
