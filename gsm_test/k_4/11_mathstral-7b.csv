How many shells do they have altogether?",44.0," Let's calculate the number of shells each person found and then add them to the initial 2 shells they already had in their collection.

Ed found:
7 limpet shells + 2 oyster shells + 4 conch shells = 7 + 2 + 4 = 13 shells

Jacob found 2 more shells than Ed, so:
13 shells (Ed's total) + 2 shells = 15 shells

Maya found 12 fewer than Jacob, so:
15 shells (Jacob's total) - 12 shells = 3 shells

Liam found 2 more than Maya, so:
3 shells (Maya's total) + 2 shells = 5 shells

Noah found 3 fewer than Liam, so:
5 shells (Liam's total) - 3 shells = 2 shells

Ava found 2 more than Noah, so:
2 shells (Noah's total) + 2 shells = 4 shells

How many more points did the Fireflies score in the game than did the Hornets?",9.0," Let's calculate the points scored by each team in the remaining time:

**Fireflies:**
- In the next 5 seconds: 7 three-point baskets = 7 * 3 = 21 points
- In the next 3 seconds: 1 two-point basket = 1 * 2 = 2 points
- In the next 8 seconds: 3 two-point baskets = 3 * 2 = 6 points
- In the last 24 seconds: 2 three-point baskets = 2 * 3 = 6 points

Total points scored by Fireflies in the remaining time = 21 + 2 + 6 + 6 = 35 points

**Hornets:**
- In the next 5 seconds: 2 two-point baskets = 2 * 2 = 4 points
- In the next 3 seconds: 2 three-point baskets = 2 * 3 = 6 points
- In the next 8 seconds: 1 two-point basket = 1 * 2 = 2 points
- In the last 24 seconds: 1 two-point basket = 1 * 2 = 2 points

Total points scored by Hornets in the remaining time = 4 + 6 + 2 + 2 = 14 points

Now, let's calculate the total points scored by each team at the end of the game:

**Fireflies:**
- Initial score: 74 points
- Additional points: 35 points

Total points for Fireflies = 74 + 35 = 109 points

**Hornets:**
- Initial score: 86 points
- Additional points: 14 points

Total points for Hornets = 86 + 14 = 100 points

Finally, let's find out how many more points the Fireflies scored than the Hornets:

Difference in points = Total points for Fireflies - Total points for Hornets
Difference in points = 109 - 100 = 9 points

The Fireflies scored 9 more points than the Hornets in the game.

For the necklace stand:
12 (total capacity) - 5 (currently held) = 7 necklaces needed
7 necklaces * $4 per necklace = $28

For the ring display:
30 (total capacity) - 18 (currently held) = 12 rings needed
12 rings * $10 per ring = $120

For the bracelet display:
15 (total capacity) - 8 (currently held) = 7 bracelets needed
7 bracelets * $5 per bracelet = $35

For the watch display:
20 (total capacity) - 7 (currently held) = 13 watchs needed
13 watchs * $25 per watch = $325

For the earring display:
50 (total capacity) - 14 (currently held) = 36 earrings needed

Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles.

Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected:
2 * 30 = 60 red marbles.

Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary, so Anie collected:
60 + 20 = 80 red marbles.

Tom collected three times as many red marbles as Mary, so Tom collected:
3 * 60 = 180 red marbles.

Sara collected 10 fewer red marbles than Anie, so Sara collected:
80 - 10 = 70 red marbles.

Leo collected three times as many red marbles as Jenny, so Leo collected:
3 * 30 = 90 red marbles.

Maya collected five times as many red marbles as Tom, so Maya collected:
5 * 180 = 900 red marbles.

Now, let's calculate the blue marbles:

Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, so Anie collected:
2 * 25 = 50 blue marbles.

Tom collected 5 fewer blue marbles than Jenny, so Tom collected:
25 - 5 = 20 blue marbles.

Sara collected five times as many blue marbles as Mary. Since Mary collected half the number of blue marbles Anie collected, Mary collected:
50 / 2 = 25 blue marbles.

So, Sara collected:
5 * 25 = 125 blue marbles.

Leo collected three times as many blue marbles as Jenny, so Leo collected:
3 * 25 = 75 blue marbles.

Maya collected 3 fewer blue marbles than Sara, so Maya collected:
125 - 3 = 122 blue marbles.

- 6 cans of Mountain Dew at 12 oz each: 6 * 12 = 72 oz
- 28 oz of ice
- 40 oz bottle of fruit juice
- 5 cans of ginger ale at 8 oz each: 5 * 8 = 40 oz
- 2 bottles of orange soda at 15 oz each: 2 * 15 = 30 oz
- 20 oz bottle of cranberry juice

If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",446.0," Let's start by calculating the number of treats and pieces of bread each person brings based on the information provided.

Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread. Since Wanda brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, we can calculate the number of treats Wanda brings:
Wanda's treats = 90 pieces of bread / 3 = 30 treats

Now, let's calculate the number of treats and pieces of bread for the other individuals based on Wanda's quantities.

Jane brings half as many treats as Wanda, so:
Jane's treats = 30 treats / 2 = 15 treats
Since Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats, we can calculate the number of pieces of bread Jane brings:
Jane's bread = 15 treats * 0.75 = 11.25 pieces of bread

Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane, so:
Carlos's treats = 15 treats / 3 = 5 treats
Since Carlos brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats, we can calculate the number of pieces of bread Carlos brings:
Carlos's bread = 5 treats * 2 = 10 pieces of bread

Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda, so:
Mia's treats = 30 treats - 10 = 20 treats
Since Mia brings half as many pieces of bread as treats, we can calculate the number of pieces of bread Mia brings:
Mia's bread = 20 treats / 2 = 10 pieces of bread

Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda, so:
Omar's treats = 30 treats * 1.5 = 45 treats
Since Omar brings four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats, we can calculate the number of pieces of bread Omar brings:
Omar's bread = 45 treats * (4/5) = 36 pieces of bread

Priya brings twice as many treats as Carlos, so:
Priya's treats = 5 treats * 2 = 10 treats
Since Priya brings one-fourth as many pieces of bread as treats, we can calculate the number of pieces of bread Priya brings:
Priya's bread = 10 treats / 4 = 2.5 pieces of bread

Now, let's add up all the pieces of bread and treats brought by everyone:

Total bread = Wanda's bread + Jane's bread + Carlos's bread + Mia's bread + Omar's bread + Priya's bread
Total bread = 90 + 11.25 + 10 + 10 + 36 + 2.5
Total bread = 160.75 pieces of bread

Total treats = Wanda's treats + Jane's treats + Carlos's treats + Mia's treats + Omar's treats + Priya's treats
Total treats = 30 + 15 + 5 + 20 + 45 + 10
Total treats = 125 treats

The total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo is:
Total = Total bread + Total treats

1. Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers.
2. Jude visited half as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa did, so Jude visited 6 / 2 = 3 rehabilitation centers.
3. Han visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude did, so Han visited (2 * 3) - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4 rehabilitation centers.
4. Jane visited 6 more than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Han did, so Jane visited (2 * 4) + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14 rehabilitation centers.
5. Omar visited 3 more rehabilitation centers than Jude did, so Omar visited 3 + 3 = 6 rehabilitation centers.
6. Priya visited 1 less than three times as many rehabilitation centers as Han did, so Priya visited (3 * 4) - 1 = 12 - 1 = 11 rehabilitation centers.

How many tarantulas does he need to see to meet his goal?",118.0," First, let's calculate the total number of legs Borgnine has seen so far.

Chimps have 4 legs each, so 12 chimps have 12 * 4 = 48 legs.
Lions have 4 legs each, so 8 lions have 8 * 4 = 32 legs.
Lizards have 4 legs each, so 5 lizards have 5 * 4 = 20 legs.
Penguins have 2 legs each, so 8 penguins have 8 * 2 = 16 legs.
Elephants have 4 legs each, so 6 elephants have 6 * 4 = 24 legs.
Parrots have 2 legs each, so 12 parrots have 12 * 2 = 24 legs.
Turtles have 4 legs each, so 4 turtles have 4 * 4 = 16 legs.

Now, let's add up all the legs Borgnine has seen:

48 (chimps) + 32 (lions) + 20 (lizards) + 16 (penguins) + 24 (elephants) + 24 (parrots) + 16 (turtles) = 180 legs.

Borgnine wants to see a total of 1100 legs. So, the number of legs he still needs to see is:

1100 (total legs) - 180 (legs already seen) = 920 legs.

Tarantulas have 8 legs each. To find out how many tarantulas Borgnine needs to see to meet his goal, we divide the remaining number of legs by the number of legs a tarantula has:

920 (remaining legs) / 8 (legs per tarantula) = 115 tarantulas.

1. Pencil: Given as 12 centimeters.
2. Pen: The pen is shorter than the pencil by 2 centimeters. So, the pen's length is 12 cm - 2 cm = 10 centimeters.
3. Rubber: The pen is longer than the rubber by 3 centimeters. So, the rubber's length is 10 cm - 3 cm = 7 centimeters.
4. Marker: The marker is 1 centimeter longer than the pencil. So, the marker's length is 12 cm + 1 cm = 13 centimeters.
5. Crayon: The crayon is 2 centimeters shorter than the rubber. So, the crayon's length is 7 cm - 2 cm = 5 centimeters.

How old is the youngest brother?,27.0," Let's denote the ages of the three oldest brothers as x, x+1, and x+2, where x is the age of the youngest of the three oldest brothers. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 96:

x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 96

Solving this equation:

3x + 3 = 96
3x = 93
x = 31

So, the youngest of the three oldest brothers is 31 years old.

Now, let's find the ages of the younger brothers:

Liam is 1 year younger than the youngest of the three oldest brothers, so Liam is 31 - 1 = 30 years old.

Noah is 1 year younger than Liam, so Noah is 30 - 1 = 29 years old.

Owen is 1 year younger than Noah, so Owen is 29 - 1 = 28 years old.

Ethan is 1 year younger than Owen, so Ethan is 28 - 1 = 27 years old.

Therefore, the youngest brother, Ethan, is 27 years old.

For the first 183 days, he rides 30 miles per day:
183 days * 30 miles/day = 5490 miles

For the next 20 days, he rides 25 miles per day:
20 days * 25 miles/day = 500 miles

For the next 30 days, he rides 40 miles per day:
30 days * 40 miles/day = 1200 miles

For the next 25 days, he rides 20 miles per day:

Apples: Last night she had 3 apples. Today she is planning to have 4 more apples than last night, so that's 3 + 4 = 7 apples.

Bananas: Last night she had 1 banana. Today she is planning to have 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, so that's 1 * 10 = 10 bananas.

Oranges: Last night she had 4 oranges. Today she is planning to have twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today, so that's 7 * 2 = 14 oranges.

Pears: Last night she had 2 pears. Today she is planning to have 2 fewer pears than the number of apples she'll have today, so that's 7 - 2 = 5 pears.

Peaches: Last night she had 3 peaches. Today she is planning to have three times as many peaches as she ate last night, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 peaches.

Grapes: Last night she had 8 grapes. Today she is planning to have half as many grapes as the oranges she'll have today, so that's 14 / 2 = 7 grapes.

Plums: Last night she had 5 plums. Today she is planning to have 1 more plum than the number of bananas she ate last night, so that's 1 + 1 = 2 plums.

1. Opal won $100.00 initially.
2. She put half into savings, which is $100.00 / 2 = $50.00.
3. She bet the other half, which is also $50.00, and made a 60% profit. The profit is 60% of $50.00, which is 0.60 * $50.00 = $30.00. So, she now has $50.00 + $30.00 = $80.00.
4. She puts half of this new amount into savings, which is $80.00 / 2 = $40.00.
5. She bets the other half, which is $40.00, and makes a 25% profit. The profit is 25% of $40.00, which is 0.25 * $40.00 = $10.00. So, she now has $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00.

7. She bets the other half, which is $25.00, and makes a 20% profit. The profit is 20% of $25.00, which is 0.20 * $25.00 = $5.00. So, she now has $25.00 + $5.00 = $30.00.
8. She puts half of this new amount into savings, which is $30.00 / 2 = $15.00.
9. She bets the other half, which is $15.00, and makes a 100% profit. The profit is 100% of $15.00, which is 1.00 * $15.00 = $15.00. So, she now has $15.00 + $15.00 = $30.00.

He buys 5 peacocks that cost 50% less each than a pony. How much did he spend?",10950.0," Let's calculate the cost for each type of animal Tim buys for his zoo.

1. Goats:
He buys 3 goats at $400 each.
Cost of goats = 3 * $400 = $1200

2. Llamas:
He gets twice as many llamas as goats, so he buys 3 * 2 = 6 llamas.
Each llama costs 50% more than a goat, so each llama costs $400 + (50% of $400) = $400 + $200 = $600.
Cost of llamas = 6 * $600 = $3600

3. Alpacas:
He buys 4 alpacas that cost 25% less each than a llama.
25% of $600 (cost of a llama) = 0.25 * $600 = $150.
So, each alpaca costs $600 - $150 = $450.
Cost of alpacas = 4 * $450 = $1800

4. Zebras:
He buys 2 zebras that cost twice as much as a goat each.
Cost of a zebra = 2 * $400 = $800.
Cost of zebras = 2 * $800 = $1600

5. Ponies:
He buys as many ponies as goats, so he buys 3 ponies.
Each pony costs $100 more than a goat, so each pony costs $400 + $100 = $500.
Cost of ponies = 3 * $500 = $1500

6. Peacocks:
He buys 5 peacocks that cost 50% less each than a pony.
50% of $500 (cost of a pony) = 0.5 * $500 = $250.
So, each peacock costs $500 - $250 = $250.
Cost of peacocks = 5 * $250 = $1250

Now, let's add up the costs for all the animals to find the total amount Tim spent:
Total cost = Cost of goats + Cost of llamas + Cost of alpacas + Cost of zebras + Cost of ponies + Cost of peacocks

How much is Peter's remaining money?",352.0," To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of each item Peter bought and then subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money he had.

1. Calculate the cost of potatoes: $2 \times 6 = \$12$

2. Calculate the cost of tomatoes: $3 \times 9 = \$27$

3. Calculate the cost of cucumbers: $4 \times 5 = \$20$

4. Calculate the cost of bananas: $5 \times 3 = \$15$

5. Calculate the cost of rice: $6 \times 4 = \$24$

6. Calculate the cost of onions: $3 \times 2 = \$6$

7. Calculate the cost of apples: $4 \times 5 = \$20$

8. Calculate the cost of chicken: $8 \times 3 = \$24$

Now, add up all the costs to find the total cost:

Total cost = \$12 + \$27 + \$20 + \$15 + \$24 + \$6 + \$20 + \$24 = \$148$

Finally, subtract the total cost from the initial amount of money Peter had:

Remaining money = \$500 - \$148 = \$352$

Two of her friends ordered the same, but each of them also bought a bowl of ice cream. One cup of coffee is $4, one piece of cake is $7, and a bowl of ice cream is $3. One more friend, Nina, ordered the same as Mell, but she also bought 2 bowls of ice cream. Two more friends each ordered 1 cup of coffee and 2 bowls of ice cream. Another friend, Omar, ordered 3 cups of coffee and 1 piece of cake. Three of her friends each ordered 1 cup of coffee and 1 piece of cake. How much money did Mell and her friends need to pay at the cafeteria?",144.0," Let's calculate the total cost step by step:

1. Mell's order: 2 cups of coffee + 1 piece of cake = 2 * $4 + $7 = $8 + $7 = $15

2. Each of the two friends who ordered the same as Mell but also bought a bowl of ice cream: 2 cups of coffee + 1 piece of cake + 1 bowl of ice cream = 2 * $4 + $7 + $3 = $8 + $7 + $3 = $18

Since there are two such friends, the total cost for their orders is 2 * $18 = $36

3. Nina's order: 2 cups of coffee + 1 piece of cake + 2 bowls of ice cream = 2 * $4 + $7 + 2 * $3 = $8 + $7 + $6 = $21

4. Each of the two friends who ordered 1 cup of coffee and 2 bowls of ice cream: 1 cup of coffee + 2 bowls of ice cream = $4 + 2 * $3 = $4 + $6 = $10

Since there are two such friends, the total cost for their orders is 2 * $10 = $20

5. Omar's order: 3 cups of coffee + 1 piece of cake = 3 * $4 + $7 = $12 + $7 = $19

6. Each of the three friends who ordered 1 cup of coffee and 1 piece of cake: 1 cup of coffee + 1 piece of cake = $4 + $7 = $11

Since there are three such friends, the total cost for their orders is 3 * $11 = $33

Now, let's add up all the costs:

Mell's order: $15
Two friends' orders: $36
Nina's order: $21
Two friends' orders: $20
Omar's order: $19
Three friends' orders: $33

Total cost = $15 + $36 + $21 + $20 + $19 + $33 = $144

Therefore, Mell and her friends needed to pay $144 at the cafeteria.

Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Another friend, Nora, is picky and will only eat one-third of what Manny eats, and Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. Another friend, Ben, will eat the same amount of lasagna as Kai. Another friend, Tina, loves lasagna and will eat 3 pieces. Another friend, Omar, will eat half as much as Kai. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",13.0," Let's calculate the total number of pieces based on the information given:

- Manny wants 1 piece.
- Aaron will not eat any lasagna.
- Kai will eat twice as much as Manny, so 2 pieces.
- Raphael will eat half as much as Manny, so 0.5 pieces.
- Lisa will eat 2 pieces plus whatever Raphael leaves, which is 0.5 pieces, so 2.5 pieces.
- Nora will eat one-third of what Manny eats, so 1/3 pieces.
- Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves, which is 2/3 pieces (since Lisa eats 2.5 pieces and Nora eats 1/3 of Manny's piece).
- Ben will eat the same amount as Kai, so 2 pieces.
- Tina will eat 3 pieces.
- Omar will eat half as much as Kai, so 1 piece.

Now, let's add up all the pieces:

Manny: 1 piece
Kai: 2 pieces
Raphael: 0.5 pieces
Lisa: 2.5 pieces
Nora: 1/3 piece
Lisa (again, for Nora's leftovers): 2/3 pieces
Ben: 2 pieces

His company has 6 sectors with different t-shirt colors. Two sectors use white t-shirts and black t-shirts. He paid $20 for white men's t-shirts and $18 for black men's t-shirts. He paid $22 for blue men's t-shirts. He paid $21 for red men's t-shirts. He paid $19 for green men's t-shirts. He paid $17 for gray men's t-shirts. Each sector has 10 men and 10 women, so there are 120 employees in total. How much did he spend total on buying t-shirts?",2040.0," To calculate the total amount Juan spent on buying t-shirts for his employees, we need to consider the cost of both men's and women's t-shirts for each color, and then sum up the costs for all sectors.

First, let's calculate the cost of women's t-shirts for each color, knowing that they are $5 cheaper than the men's t-shirts of the same color:

- White women's t-shirts: $20 - $5 = $15
- Black women's t-shirts: $18 - $5 = $13
- Blue women's t-shirts: $22 - $5 = $17
- Red women's t-shirts: $21 - $5 = $16
- Green women's t-shirts: $19 - $5 = $14
- Gray women's t-shirts: $17 - $5 = $12

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each color, considering there are 10 men and 10 women in each sector:

- White t-shirts (men + women): ($20 * 10) + ($15 * 10) = $200 + $150 = $350
- Black t-shirts (men + women): ($18 * 10) + ($13 * 10) = $180 + $130 = $310
- Blue t-shirts (men + women): ($22 * 10) + ($17 * 10) = $220 + $170 = $390
- Red t-shirts (men + women): ($21 * 10) + ($16 * 10) = $210 + $160 = $370
- Green t-shirts (men + women): ($19 * 10) + ($14 * 10) = $190 + $140 = $330
- Gray t-shirts (men + women): ($17 * 10) + ($12 * 10) = $170 + $120 = $290

Since there are two sectors using white and black t-shirts, we need to multiply the total cost for these colors by 2:

- White t-shirts total: $350 * 2 = $700
- Black t-shirts total: $310 * 2 = $620

Now, let's sum up the total cost for all colors:

- Total cost for white and black t-shirts: $700 + $620 = $1320
- Total cost for blue, red, green, and gray t-shirts: $390 + $370 + $330 + $290 = $1380

Finally, we add the total costs for all colors to find the overall total amount spent:

- Overall total amount spent: $1320 + $1380 = $2700

How many fish do all the people mentioned have put together?,265.0," Let's solve this step by step:

1. Billy has 10 fish.
2. Tony has 3 times as many fish as Billy, so Tony has 3 * 10 = 30 fish.
3. Sarah has 5 more fish than Tony, so Sarah has 30 + 5 = 35 fish.
4. Bobby has twice as many fish as Sarah, so Bobby has 2 * 35 = 70 fish.
5. Nina has 2 fewer fish than Billy, so Nina has 10 - 2 = 8 fish.
6. Omar has half as many fish as Bobby, so Omar has 70 / 2 = 35 fish.
7. Priya has 4 times as many fish as Nina, so Priya has 4 * 8 = 32 fish.
8. Chen has 10 more fish than Sarah, so Chen has 35 + 10 = 45 fish.

1. McKenna has 34 stuffed animals.

2. Kenley has twice as many as McKenna, so Kenley has 2 * 34 = 68 stuffed animals.

3. Tenly has 5 more than Kenley, so Tenly has 68 + 5 = 73 stuffed animals.

4. Riley has 10 fewer stuffed animals than Tenly, so Riley has 73 - 10 = 63 stuffed animals.
