How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle, Alice, Bob, David and Zoe have together if Zoe has 20 sheep?",16380.0,"Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Let's denote the number of sheep in each city as follows: T = Toulouse, C = Charleston, S = Seattle, A = Alice, B = Bob, D = David, and Z = Zoe.

2. We know that Z has 20 sheep, so Z = 20.

3. Since David has 2 times as many sheep as Zoe, D = 2 * 20 = 40.

4. Bob has 3 times as many sheep as David, so B = 3 * 40 = 120.

5. Alice has 5 times as many sheep as Bob, so A = 5 * 120 = 600.

6. Seattle has 2 times as many sheep as Alice, so S = 2 * 600 = 1200.

7. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so C = 4 * 1200 = 4800.

8. Toulouse has 2 times as many sheep as Charleston, so T = 2 * 4800 = 9600.

So, Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle, Alice, Bob, David, and Zoe have a total of 9600 (T) + 4800 (C) + 1200 (S) + 600 (A) + 120 (B) + 40 (D) + 20 (Z) = 20,000 sheep together.","20,000",20000.0,False,

1. Red candies: Maria said there were 40 red candies.

2. Yellow candies: There are three times as many yellow candies as red candies, so there are 3 * 40 = 120 yellow candies. Carlos ate all of them, so we subtract 120 from the total number of candies.

3. Blue candies: There are half as many blue candies as yellow candies, so there are 120 / 2 = 60 blue candies.

4. Green candies: There are half as many green candies as red candies, so there are 40 * 2 = 80 green candies.

5. Purple candies: There are five times as many purple candies as yellow candies, so there are 120 * 5 - 10 = 610 - 10 = 600 purple candies.

Total wall area = 8600 sq ft

Since one gallon of paint covers 600 square feet, we can find out how many gallons of paint Henrietta needs by dividing the total wall area by the coverage per gallon:

Number of gallons = 8600 sq ft / 600 sq ft/gallon
Number of gallons = 14.333333333333334 gallons

1. Let A be the number of antelopes, R be the number of rabbits, H be the number of hyenas, W be the number of wild dogs, L be the number of leopards, Z be the number of zebras, B be the number of buffaloes, and M be the number of monkeys.

2. We know that A + R = A + 34 (since there are 34 more rabbits than antelopes).

3. We also know that A + R + H = A + R + A + R + 42 (since there are 42 fewer hyenas than the total number of antelopes and rabbits combined).

4. From the third equation, we can find H: H = 2A + 42 - 2R.

5. We know that W = H + 50 (since there are 50 more wild dogs than hyenas).

1. Necklaces: The necklace stand can hold 12 necklaces, but currently holds 5. So, we need 12 - 5 = 7 more necklaces. The cost for these would be 7 * $4 = $28.

2. Rings: The ring display can hold 30 rings, but currently holds 18. So, we need 30 - 18 = 12 more rings. The cost for these would be 12 * $10 = $120.

3. Bracelets: The bracelet display can hold 15 bracelets, but currently holds 8. So, we need 15 - 8 = 7 more bracelets. The cost for these would be 7 * $5 = $35.

1. Jenny collected 30 red marbles. Let's call the number of red marbles collected by Mary m, Anie a, Tom t, and Leo l. So, Mary collected m = 2 * 30 = 60 - t red marbles, Tom collected t red marbles, and Leo collected l = 3 * 30 = 90 - t red marbles. Maya collected 5 * t red marbles.

2. Jenny collected 25 blue marbles. Mary collected half of Anie's blue marbles, so Mary collected m/2 = (20 + a)/2 blue marbles. Tom collected 5 times as many blue marbles as Mary, so Tom collected 5 * (m/2) blue marbles. Leo collected 3 times as many blue marbles as Jenny, so Leo collected 3 * 25 blue marbles. Sara collected 5 times as many blue marbles as Mary, so Sara collected 5 * (m/2) blue marbles. Maya collected 3 fewer blue marbles than Sara, so Maya collected 5 * (m/2) - 3 blue marbles.

3. We know that Leo collected 90 - t - t = 90 - 2t red marbles, and Maya collected 5 * (90 - 2t) red marbles. Since Leo collected three times as many red marbles as Jenny, we can write the equation 3 * 30 = 90 - 2t, which solves to t = 10.

4. Now we know that Tom collected 10 red marbles, and Maya collected 5 * (10) = 50 red marbles.

5. We also know that Tom collected 5 * (m/2) blue marbles, Leo collected 3 * 25 blue marbles, Sara collected 5 * (m/2) - 3 blue marbles, and Maya collected 5 * (m/2) - 3 - 3 blue marbles. Since Maya collected 50 red marbles, we know that m = 2 * 30 - 50 = 10 red marbles. So, Tom collected 5 * (10/2) = 25 blue marbles, Leo collected 3 * 25 = 75 blue marbles, Sara collected 5 * (10/2) - 3 = 24 blue marbles, and Maya collected 5 * (10/2) - 3 - 3 = 18 blue marbles.

Ginger ale: 5 * 8 = 40 oz
Orange soda: 2 * 15 = 30 oz

Now, let's add up all the volumes:

Total volume = 72 + 28 + 40 + 40 + 30 + 20 + 30 = 240 oz

Since there are 16 ounces in a quart, we can convert the total volume to quarts:

Since he spends 20 minutes giving her a bath and half as long blow-drying, the time spent blow-drying is 20 minutes * 0.5 = 10 minutes.

Next, let's find out how long he spends brushing his dog. The answer is 8 minutes.

Then, let's find out how long he spends trimming her nails. Since he spends half as long trimming as he spent brushing, the time spent trimming is 8 minutes * 0.5 = 4 minutes.

Now, let's find out how long he drives to the trailhead. The distance is 9 miles, and he drives at 30 miles per hour. To find the time, we use the formula time = distance / speed, so the time is 9 miles / 30 miles per hour = 0.3 hours or 18 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).

At the trailhead, he spends 6 minutes filling her water bowl and giving her a treat.

Finally, he takes her for a walk along a 3-mile trail. If he walks at 6 miles per hour, the time spent walking is 3 miles / 6 miles per hour = 0.5 hours or 30 minutes.

2. Oranges = Mangoes + 200 kg (since the total produce of oranges was 200 kg more than that of mangoes)

Then, let's calculate the monthly cost per person for club membership, maintenance, and gym access: $1000 (club membership) + $600 (maintenance) + $50 (gym access) = $1650.

Since there are 4 family members, the total monthly cost for the family is $1650 * 4 = $6600.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total annual cost for the family for club membership, maintenance, and gym access is $6600 * 12 = $79200.

Savanna National park has twice as many crocodiles as Safari National park. How many animals in total does Savanna National park have?",705.0,"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Safari National park has 100 lions, half as many snakes (let's call this S), and 10 fewer giraffes than snakes, so Safari has G = S - 10. It also has twice as many zebras as giraffes, so Safari has Z = 2*(G - 10) = 2*(S - 10) - 20.

2. Savanna National park has double as many lions as Safari National park, so Savanna has 2 * 100 = 200 lions. It has triple as many snakes as Safari National park, so Savanna has 3 * S snakes. It has 20 more elephants than Safari National park, so Savanna has E = S + 20 + 5 = S + 25 elephants. It has 20 more giraffes than Safari National park, so Savanna has G + 20 giraffes. It has half as many zebras as lions, so Savanna has Z/2 zebras. It has 10 fewer monkeys than its zebras, so Savanna has M = Z/2 - 10 monkeys.

3. Savanna National park also has one-fifth as many crocodiles as lions, so Savanna has C = (1/5) * 200 = 40 crocodiles. Safari National park has one-fifth as many crocodiles as lions, so Safari has C/5 crocodiles. Since Savanna has twice as many crocodiles as Safari, Savanna has 2 * (C/5) = 8 * (Safari's crocodiles) crocodiles.

4. Now we have the number of animals for each type in both parks. To find the total number of animals in Savanna National park, we add up all the animals:

   Total animals in Savanna National park = Lions + Snakes + Elephants + Giraffes + Zebras + Monkeys + Crocodiles

   Where Lions = 200, Snakes = 3S, Elephants = S + 25, Giraffes = G + 20, Zebras = 2*(G - 10) - 20, Monkeys = (Z/2) - 10, and Crocodiles = 8 * (Safari's crocodiles).

   Since we don't know the exact number of snakes in Safari National park, we can't find the exact number of total animals in Savanna National park. However, we can express the total number of animals in Savanna National park as a function of the number of snakes in Safari National park:

   Total animals in Savanna National park = 200 + 3S + S + 25 + G + 2*(G - 10) - 20 + (Z/2) - 10 + 8 * (Safari's crocodiles)

1. Goats: Tim buys 3 goats at $400 each, so the total cost for goats is 3 * $400 = $1200.

2. Llamas: Tim gets twice as many llamas as goats, so he gets 3 * 2 = 6 llamas. Since they cost 50% more than a goat, the cost for each llama is $400 * 1.5 = $600. So the total cost for llamas is 6 * $600 = $3600.

3. Alpacas: Since there are twice as many llamas as alpacas, there are 6 / 2 = 3 alpacas. Since they cost 25% less than a llama, the cost for each alpaca is $600 * 0.75 = $450. So the total cost for alpacas is 3 * $450 = $1350.

4. Zebras: Tim buys 2 zebras that cost twice as much as a goat. Since a goat costs $400, each zebra costs 2 * $400 = $800. So the total cost for zebras is 2 * $800 = $1600.

5. Ponies: Tim buys as many ponies as goats, so he buys 3 ponies. Each pony costs $100 more than a goat, so each pony costs $400 + $100 = $500. So the total cost for ponies is 3 * $500 = $1500.

6. Peacocks: Tim buys 5 peacocks that cost 50% less than a pony. Since a pony costs $500, each peacock costs $500 * 0.5 = $250. So the total cost for peacocks is 5 * $250 = $1250.

Two of her friends ordered the same, but each of them also bought a bowl of ice cream. One cup of coffee is $4, one piece of cake is $7, and a bowl of ice cream is $3. One more friend, Nina, ordered the same as Mell, but she also bought 2 bowls of ice cream. Two more friends each ordered 1 cup of coffee and 2 bowls of ice cream. Another friend, Omar, ordered 3 cups of coffee and 1 piece of cake. Three of her friends each ordered 1 cup of coffee and 1 piece of cake. How much money did Mell and her friends need to pay at the cafeteria?",144.0,"First, let's calculate the cost for Mell's order:
2 cups of coffee * $4/cup = $8
1 piece of cake * $7/piece = $7
1 bowl of ice cream * $3/bowl = $3

For Mell's friends who ordered the same as her but with 2 bowls of ice cream:
(Number of friends - 1) * (cost of 2 bowls of ice cream - cost of 1 bowl of ice cream) = (5 - 1) * ($3 * 2 - $3) = $10

For the friends who ordered 1 cup of coffee and 2 bowls of ice cream:
(Number of friends who ordered this - 1) * (cost of 1 cup of coffee + 2 bowls of ice cream - cost of 1 cup of coffee) = (3 - 1) * ($4 + $3 * 2 - $4) = $15

For the friend who ordered 3 cups of coffee and 1 piece of cake:
Cost of 3 cups of coffee = $3 * 3 = $9
Cost of 1 piece of cake = $7
Total cost = $9 + $7 = $16

For the friends who each ordered 1 cup of coffee and 1 piece of cake:
(Number of friends who ordered this - 1) * (cost of 1 cup of coffee + cost of 1 piece of cake - cost of 1 cup of coffee) = (3 - 1) * ($4 + $7 - $4) = $18

Mell's order: $8 + $7 + $3 = $18
Friends with the same order as Mell: $10
Friends with 1 cup of coffee and 2 bowls of ice cream: $15
Friend with 3 cups of coffee and 1 piece of cake: $16

1,mistral-7b,mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3,4,44,43,"Manny is making lasagna for dinner with his four friends, Lisa, Raphael, Aaron, and Kai. He needs to know how many pieces to cut the lasagna into to serve it. Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Another friend, Nora, is picky and will only eat one-third of what Manny eats, and Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. Another friend, Ben, will eat the same amount of lasagna as Kai. Another friend, Tina, loves lasagna and will eat 3 pieces. Another friend, Omar, will eat half as much as Kai. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",13.0,"Let's break down the amount of lasagna each person will eat:

1. Manny: 1 piece (since he only wants one)
2. Aaron: 0 pieces (he'll only eat garlic bread and salad)
3. Kai: 2 * Manny's pieces (since he eats twice as much as Manny)
4. Raphael: 0.5 * Manny's pieces (since he eats half the amount Manny does)
5. Lisa (from her own piece): 1 piece
6. Lisa (from Raphael's leftovers): Raphael's leftovers = Manny's pieces - Raphael's pieces = Manny's pieces - 0.5 * Manny's pieces = 0.5 * Manny's pieces
7. Nora: 1/3 * Manny's pieces (since she eats 1/3 of what Manny eats)
8. Lisa (from Nora's leftovers): Nora's leftovers = Manny's pieces / 3
9. Ben: Kai's pieces = 2 * Manny's pieces
10. Tina: 3 pieces
11. Omar: 0.5 * Kai's pieces = 0.5 * (2 * Manny's pieces) = Manny's pieces

Now, let's add up the total amount of lasagna needed:

1 + 0 + 2M + 0.5M + 0.5M + 1 + 0.5M/3 + 1 + 2M + M + 0.5M = 6M + 3.5M/3

Since Manny only wants one piece, we need to find a common multiple of 3 and the denominator of the fraction (3) to make the calculation easier. The least common multiple of 3 and 3 is 3, so we'll multiply the fraction by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

6M + 3.5M/3 * 3 = 18M + 10.5M = 28.5M

Since we can't cut a fraction of a piece, we'll round up to the nearest whole number:

29 pieces

So, Manny should cut his lasagna into 29 pieces to serve everyone.",29,29.0,False,

He paid $20 for white men's t-shirts and $18 for black men's t-shirts. He paid $22 for blue men's t-shirts. He paid $21 for red men's t-shirts. He paid $19 for green men's t-shirts. He paid $17 for gray men's t-shirts. Each sector has 10 men and 10 women, so there are 120 employees in total. How much did he spend total on buying t-shirts?",2040.0,"First, let's find the cost for men's t-shirts of each color. Since there are 10 men in each sector and 6 sectors, there are a total of 60 men.

For white men's t-shirts, the cost is $20.
For black men's t-shirts, the cost is $18.
For blue men's t-shirts, the cost is $22.
For red men's t-shirts, the cost is $19.
For green men's t-shirts, the cost is $19 (since women's t-shirts are $5 cheaper, the cost for men's green t-shirts is the same as red t-shirts).
For gray men's t-shirts, the cost is $17.

The total cost for men's t-shirts is $20 (white) + $18 (black) + $22 (blue) + $19 (red and green) + $17 (gray) = $106.

Now, let's find the cost for women's t-shirts. Since women's t-shirts are $5 cheaper than men's t-shirts of the same color, the cost for women's t-shirts is $5 less for each color.

For white women's t-shirts, the cost is $20 - $5 = $15.
For black women's t-shirts, the cost is $18 - $5 = $13.
For blue women's t-shirts, the cost is $22 - $5 = $17.
For red women's t-shirts, the cost is $19 - $5 = $14.
For green women's t-shirts, the cost is $19 - $5 = $14 (since women's green t-shirts are already $5 cheaper than men's green t-shirts).
For gray women's t-shirts, the cost is $17 - $5 = $12.

Since there are 10 women in each sector, the total cost for women's t-shirts is $15 (white) * 10 + $13 (black) * 10 + $17 (blue) * 10 + $14 (red and green) * 10 + $12 (gray) * 10 = $1500.

The total cost for all t-shirts is the sum of the cost for men's and women's t-shirts, which is $106 (men) + $1500 (women) = $1506.

However, since there are 120 employees in total (10 men and 10 women in each of the 6 sectors), the total number of t-shirts bought is 120 * 2 = 240 t-shirts. The total cost should be the cost per t-shirt multiplied by the total number of t-shirts. So, the total cost is $1506 / 2 = $753.

1. Billy has 10 fish.
2. Nina has 2 fewer fish than Billy, so Nina has 10 - 2 = 8 fish.
3. Priya has 4 times as many fish as Nina, so Priya has 8 * 4 = 32 fish.
4. Tony has 3 times as many fish as Billy, so Tony has 10 * 3 = 30 fish.
5. Sarah has 5 more fish than Tony, so Sarah has 30 + 5 = 35 fish.

What is the total number of legs in his entire collection?,270.0,"To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of legs for each type of creature and then add them up.

1. Spiders: Each spider has 8 legs, so Monroe has 8 * 8 = 64 spider legs.
2. Ants: Each ant has 6 legs, so Monroe has 12 * 6 = 72 ant legs.
3. Beetles: Each beetle has 6 legs, so Monroe has 5 * 6 = 30 beetle legs.

The machine has twice as many orange gumballs as blue gumballs. The machine has one-fourth as many pink gumballs as green gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",101.0,"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are 16 red gumballs. Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as B, green gumballs as G, yellow gumballs as Y, purple gumballs as P, orange gumballs as O, and pink gumballs as PK.

2. The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs, so B = 16/2 = 8.

3. For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. So, G = 8 * 4 = 32.

4. The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs, so Y = 8.

5. The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs, so P = 16 - 3 = 13.

6. The machine has twice as many orange gumballs as blue gumballs, so O = 2 * 8 = 16.

7. The machine has one-fourth as many pink gumballs as green gumballs, so PK = G / 4.

8. Now we have a system of equations:
   - B + G + Y + P + O + PK = Total number of gumballs
   - B = 8
   - G = 32
   - Y = 8
   - P = 13
   - O = 16
   - PK = G / 4

9. We can substitute the known values into the total equation: 8 + 32 + 8 + 13 + 16 + PK = Total number of gumballs.

10. We also have PK = G / 4, so we can substitute PK into the total equation: 8 + 32 + 8 + 13 + 16 + (32 / 4) = Total number of gumballs.

11. Solving the equation, we get Total number of gumballs = 8 + 32 + 8 + 13 + 16 + (32 / 4) = 8 + 32 + 8 + 13 + 16 + 8 = 75 gumballs.
