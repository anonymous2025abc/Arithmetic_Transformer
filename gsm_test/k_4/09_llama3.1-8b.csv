1. Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread. Since she brings half as many treats as Jane, we need to find Jane's number of treats first. Let's denote Jane's number of treats as J.

Since the ages of the three oldest brothers are consecutive integers, the ages of the other two brothers will be x + 1 and x + 2.

We are given that the sum of their ages is 96. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 96

Combine like terms:

Now, let's add up the number of questions each competitor got correct and wrong:

Drew: 20 + 6 = 26
Carla: 14 + 12 = 26
Maya: 17 + 8 = 25
Eli: 19 + 6 = 25
Sasha: 12 + 8 = 20

Given that the total produce of mangoes is 400 kg.

1. The total produce of apples is twice the total produce of mangoes:
   Total produce of apples = 2 * 400 = 800 kg

2. The total produce of oranges is 200 kg more than that of mangoes:
   Total produce of oranges = 400 + 200 = 600 kg

2. The monthly cost is $1000 per person. Since there are 4 family members, the total monthly cost is:

He needs to know how many pieces to cut the lasagna into to serve it. Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Another friend, Nora, is picky and will only eat one-third of what Manny eats, and Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. Another friend, Ben, will eat the same amount of lasagna as Kai. Another friend, Tina, loves lasagna and will eat 3 pieces. Another friend, Omar, will eat half as much as Kai. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",13.0,"To find the total number of pieces Manny should cut, we need to calculate the amount each person will eat and add them up.

1. Manny: 1 piece
2. Aaron: 0 pieces (he won't eat lasagna)
3. Kai: 2 pieces (he eats twice as much as Manny)
4. Raphael: 0.5 pieces (he eats half as much as Manny)
5. Lisa: 2.5 pieces (she eats 2 pieces and Raphael's leftover 0.5 piece)
6. Nora: 0.33 pieces (she eats one-third of Manny's piece)
7. Ben: 2 pieces (he eats the same amount as Kai)
8. Tina: 3 pieces
9. Omar: 1 piece (he eats half as much as Kai)

Now, let's add up the total number of pieces:
1 + 0 + 2 + 0.5 + 2.5 + 0.33 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 11.83

Since we can't cut a fraction of a piece, we need to round up to the nearest whole number to ensure everyone gets enough lasagna. Therefore, Manny should cut his lasagna into 12 pieces.
