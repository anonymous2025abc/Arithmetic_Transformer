If the Carlo Rosi is 40 years old, what is the total age of all the listed wines?",410.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of each wine based on the given relationships and then sum their ages.

1. **Carlo Rosi's Age:**
   - Given: Carlo Rosi is 40 years old.

2. **Twin Valley's Age:**
   - Carlo Rosi is four times as old as the Twin Valley.
   \[
   \text{Twin Valley} = \frac{\text{Carlo Rosi}}{4} = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Franzia's Age:**
   - Franzia is three times as old as the Carlo Rosi.
   \[
   \text{Franzia} = 3 \times \text{Carlo Rosi} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ years}
   \]

4. **Silver Ridge's Age:**
   - Silver Ridge is the same age as the Franzia.
   \[
   \text{Silver Ridge} = 120 \text{ years}
   \]

5. **Old Vine's Age:**
   - Old Vine is twice as old as the Twin Valley.
   \[
   \text{Old Vine} = 2 \times \text{Twin Valley} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ years}
   \]

6. **Crestwood's Age:**
   - Crestwood is the same age as the Carlo Rosi.
   \[
   \text{Crestwood} = 40 \text{ years}
   \]

7. **Barrel Hill's Age:**
   - Barrel Hill is three times as old as the Old Vine.
   \[
   \text{Barrel Hill} = 3 \times \text{Old Vine} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ years}
   \]

Now, let's sum up the ages of all the wines:

\[
\text{Total Age} = \text{Franzia} + \text{Silver Ridge} + \text{Old Vine} + \text{Crestwood} + \text{Barrel Hill} + \text{Twin Valley}

Sara collected five times as many blue marbles as Mary. Leo collected three times as many red marbles as Jenny. Leo collected three times as many blue marbles as Jenny. Maya collected five times as many red marbles as Tom. Maya collected 3 fewer blue marbles than Sara. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?",442.0,"Let's start by determining the number of red and blue marbles each friend collected based on the information given.

First, we know that Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles. Let's denote the number of red marbles Jenny collected as \( J_r \) and the number of blue marbles she collected as \( J_b \). So,
\[ J_r = 30 \]
\[ J_b = 25 \]

Next, let's find out how many red and blue marbles Mary collected. According to the problem, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie. Let's denote the number of red marbles Mary collected as \( M_r \) and the number of blue marbles she collected as \( M_b \).

Since Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny,
\[ M_r = 2J_r = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

And since Mary collected half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie,
\[ M_b = \frac{1}{2}A_b \]
where \( A_b \) is the number of blue marbles Anie collected. We don't have the exact value for \( A_b \), but we can express it in terms of \( M_b \):
\[ A_b = 2M_b \]

Now, let's determine how many red and blue marbles Anie collected. The problem states that Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. Let's denote the number of red marbles Anie collected as \( A_r \) and the number of blue marbles she collected as \( A_b \).

Since Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary,
\[ A_r = M_r + 20 = 60 + 20 = 80 \]

And since Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected,
\[ A_b = 2J_b = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

So, Anie collected 80 red marbles and 50 blue marbles.

Next, let's find out how many red and blue marbles Tom collected. The problem states that Tom collected three times as many red marbles as Mary. Let's denote the number of red marbles Tom collected as \( T_r \) and the number of blue marbles he collected as \( T_b \).

Since Tom collected three times as many red marbles as Mary,
\[ T_r = 3M_r = 3 \times 60 = 180 \]

Tom also collected 5 fewer blue marbles than Jenny. Since Jenny collected 25 blue marbles,
\[ T_b = J_b - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 \]

So, Tom collected 180 red marbles and 20 blue marbles.

Now, let's find out how many red and blue marbles Sara collected. The problem states that Sara collected 10 fewer red marbles than Anie and five times the number of blue marbles Mary collected. Let's denote the number of red marbles Sara collected as \( S_r \) and the number of blue marbles she collected as \( S_b \).

Since Sara collected 10 fewer red marbles than Anie,
\[ S_r = A_r - 10 = 80 - 10 = 70 \]

And since Sara collected five times the number of blue marbles Mary collected,
\[ S_b = 5M_b = 5 \times 60 = 300 \]

So, Sara collected 70 red marbles and 300 blue marbles.

Finally, let's find out how many red and blue marbles Leo collected. The problem states that Leo collected three times as many red marbles as Jenny and three times as many blue marbles as Jenny. Let's denote the number of red marbles Leo collected as \( L_r \) and the number of blue marbles he collected as \( L_b \).

Since Leo collected three times as many red marbles as Jenny,
\[ L_r = 3J_r = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Leo also collected three times as many blue marbles as Jenny,
\[ L_b = 3J_b = 3 \times 25 = 75 \]

So, Leo collected 90 red marbles and 75 blue marbles.

Lastly, let's find out how many red and blue marbles Maya collected. The problem states that Maya collected five times as many red marbles as Tom and three fewer blue marbles than Sara. Let's denote the number of red marbles Maya collected as \( M_m \) and the number of blue marbles she collected as \( M_m \).

Since Maya collected five times as many red marbles as Tom,
\[ M_m = 5T_r = 5 \times 180 = 900 \]

And since Maya collected three fewer blue marbles than Sara,
\[ M_m = S_b - 3 = 300 - 3 = 297 \]

So, Maya collected 900 red marbles and 297 blue marbles.

To find the total number of blue marbles collected by all the friends together, we sum up the blue marbles collected by each friend:
\[ J_b + A_b + M_b + T_b + S_b + L_b + M_m = 25 + 50 + 60 + 20 + 300 + 75 + 297 = 747 \]

Therefore, the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together is \(\boxed{747}\).",747,747.0,False,

- The area of one of Mancino's gardens is \(16 \times 5 = 80 \text{ square feet}\).

Since he has 3 such gardens, the total area for Mancino is:
\[3 \times 80 = 240 \text{ square feet}\]

Next, let's calculate the area of one garden from Marquita:
- Each of her gardens measures \(8 \text{ feet} \times 4 \text{ feet}\).
- The area of one of Marquita's gardens is \(8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ square feet}\).

Since she has 2 such gardens, the total area for Marquita is:
\[2 \times 32 = 64 \text{ square feet}\]

Now, let's calculate the area of one garden from Luis:
- Each of his gardens measures \(10 \text{ feet} \times 6 \text{ feet}\).
- The area of one of Luis's gardens is \(10 \times 6 = 60 \text{ square feet}\).

Since he has 4 such gardens, the total area for Luis is:
\[4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ square feet}\]

Next, let's calculate the area of one garden from Tasha:
- Her garden measures \(12 \text{ feet} \times 9 \text{ feet}\).
- The area of Tasha's garden is \(12 \times 9 = 108 \text{ square feet}\).

Since she has 1 such garden, the total area for Tasha is:
\[1 \times 108 = 108 \text{ square feet}\]

Finally, let's calculate the area of one garden from Nia:
- Each of her gardens measures \(7 \text{ feet} \times 7 \text{ feet}\).
- The area of one of Nia's gardens is \(7 \times 7 = 49 \text{ square feet}\).

Since she has 2 such gardens, the total area for Nia is:
\[2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ square feet}\]

And finally, let's calculate the area of one garden from Omar:
- Each of his gardens measures \(5 \text{ feet} \times 14 \text{ feet}\).
- The area of one of Omar's gardens is \(5 \times 14 = 70 \text{ square feet}\).

Since he has 3 such gardens, the total area for Omar is:
\[3 \times 70 = 210 \text{ square feet}\]

Now, we add up all the areas calculated above:
\[240 + 64 + 240 + 108 + 98 + 210\]

Let's perform the addition step-by-step:
\[240 + 64 = 304\]
\[304 + 240 = 544\]
\[544 + 108 = 652\]
\[652 + 98 = 750\]
\[750 + 210 = 960\]

So, the total area of all the gardens combined is:

Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda and half as many pieces of bread as treats. Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda and four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats. Priya brings twice as many treats as Carlos and one-fourth as many pieces of bread as treats. If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",446.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pieces of bread and treats each person brought to the zoo based on the given relationships and then sum them up.

Let's start with Wanda:

- Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread.
- Since Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane, let \( T_J \) be the number of treats Jane brings. Then, \( \frac{1}{2}T_J = 90 \), so \( T_J = 180 \).
- Wanda also brings three times as many pieces of bread as treats, which matches our information about her bringing 90 pieces of bread.

Next, let's find out how much Jane brought:

- Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats, so if she brings \( B_J \) pieces of bread, then \( B_J = 0.75T_J \). We already know \( T_J = 180 \), so \( B_J = 0.75 \times 180 = 135 \).

Now, let's calculate for Wanda again but using these values:

- Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, which is correct.
- She brings half as many treats as Jane, so \( T_W = \frac{1}{2}B_J = \frac{1}{2} \times 135 = 67.5 \). However, since the number of treats must be an integer, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or typo in the problem statement. Assuming the problem meant to say ""half as many treats"" instead of ""half as many pieces of bread,"" we'll proceed with \( T_W = 67.5 \).

For Carlos:

- Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane, so \( T_C = \frac{1}{3}T_J = \frac{1}{3} \times 180 = 60 \).
- Carlos brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats, so \( B_C = 2T_C = 2 \times 60 = 120 \).

For Mia:

- Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda, so \( T_M = T_W - 10 = 67.5 - 10 = 57.5 \). Again, assuming the problem meant to say ""10 fewer treats"" instead of ""10 more treats,"" we'll proceed with \( T_M = 57.5 \).
- Mia brings half as many pieces of bread as treats, so \( B_M = \frac{1}{2}T_M = \frac{1}{2} \times 57.5 = 28.75 \). Assuming the problem meant to say ""half as many pieces of bread"" instead of ""half as many treats,"" we'll proceed with \( B_M = 28.75 \).

For Omar:

- Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda, so \( T_O = 1.5T_W = 1.5 \times 90 = 135 \).
- Omar brings four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats, so \( B_O = \frac{4}{5}T_O = \frac{4}{5} \times 135 = 108 \).

Finally, for Priya:

- Priya brings twice as many treats as Carlos, so \( T_P = 2T_C = 2 \times 60 = 120 \).
- Priya brings one-fourth as many pieces of bread as treats, so \( B_P = \frac{1}{4}T_P = \frac{1}{4} \times 120 = 30 \).

Summing up all the pieces of bread and treats:

- Total pieces of bread: \( B_J + B_W + B_C + B_M + B_O + B_P = 135 + 90 + 120 + 28.75 + 108 + 30 = 501.75 \)
- Total treats: \( T_J + T_W + T_C + T_M + T_O + T_P = 180 + 90 + 60 + 57.5 + 135 + 120 = 602.5 \)

Since the number of treats must be an integer, we should round the totals to the nearest whole number:

- Total pieces of bread: \( 502 \)
- Total treats: \( 603 \)

So, the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo is:

If Marcus walks at 6 miles per hour, how much time does he spend with his dog total?",96.0,"To determine the total time Marcus spends with his dog, we need to break down each activity and sum up the times.

1. **Bath Time:**
   Marcus spends 20 minutes giving his dog a bath.

2. **Blow-Drying Time:**
   Marcus spends half as long blow-drying his dog as he did bathing her. Therefore, the blow-drying time is:
   \[
   \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Brushing Time:**
   Marcus spends 8 minutes brushing his dog.

4. **Trimming Nails Time:**
   Marcus spends half as long trimming her nails as he spent brushing her. Therefore, the trimming nails time is:
   \[
   \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ minutes}

5. **Driving Time to Trailhead:**
   Marcus drives 9 miles to the trailhead at 30 miles per hour. The driving time is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}

6. **Filling Water Bowl and Giving Treats:**
   Marcus spends 6 minutes filling her water bowl and giving her a treat.

7. **Walking Along the Trail:**
   Marcus takes his dog for a walk along a 3-mile trail at 6 miles per hour. The walking time is calculated similarly:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}

**Step-by-Step Calculation:**

1. **Apples:**
   - Last night: 3 apples
   - Today: \(3 + 4 = 7\) apples

2. **Bananas:**
   - Last night: 1 banana
   - Today: \(1 \times 10 = 10\) bananas

3. **Oranges:**
   - Last night: 4 oranges
   - Today: \(7 \times 2 = 14\) oranges

4. **Pears:**
   - Last night: 2 pears
   - Today: \(2 - 2 = 0\) pears (since she has no pears left)

5. **Peaches:**
   - Last night: 3 peaches
   - Today: \(3 \times 3 = 9\) peaches

6. **Grapes:**
   - Last night: 8 grapes

Let's denote the time it takes for Emma to run all around the two arenas as \( E \). According to the problem, \( E = 20 \) hours.

Next, let's find out how long it takes for Fernando to run all around the two arenas. The problem states that it takes Fernando twice as long as Emma, so:
\[ F = 2E = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for Gina to run all around the two arenas. The problem says Gina takes half as long as Fernando, so:
\[ G = \frac{F}{2} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ hours} \]

Next, let's determine the time it takes for Harold to run all around the two arenas. It is given that Harold takes 10 hours more than Emma, so:
\[ H = E + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ hours} \]

Now, let's find out how long it takes for Ivy to run all around the two arenas. The problem states that Ivy takes 5 hours less than Fernando, so:
\[ I = F - 5 = 40 - 5 = 35 \text{ hours} \]

Finally, let's calculate the time it takes for Jack to run all around the two arenas. The problem indicates that Jack takes three times as long as Gina, so:
\[ J = 3G = 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we sum up the times taken by each person to get the total time:

The total produce of lemons was 50 kg more than the total produce of peaches. If his farm produced 400 kg of mangoes and he sold the fruits at $50 per kg, calculate the total amount of money he got in that season.",162500.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total produce of each type of fruit and then calculate the total revenue from selling all the fruits.

Let's start with the given information:

1. Total produce of mangoes = 400 kg
2. Total produce of apples = 2 * (total produce of mangoes)
3. Total produce of oranges = total produce of mangoes + 200 kg
4. Total produce of bananas = total produce of apples - 100 kg
5. Total produce of peaches = total produce of oranges / 2
6. Total produce of guavas = total produce of mangoes / 4
7. Total produce of lemons = total produce of peaches + 50 kg

Now let's calculate each quantity step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total produce of apples
Total produce of apples = 2 * (total produce of mangoes) 
= 2 * 400 kg
= 800 kg

### Step 2: Calculate the total produce of oranges
Total produce of oranges = total produce of mangoes + 200 kg
= 400 kg + 200 kg
= 600 kg

### Step 3: Calculate the total produce of bananas
Total produce of bananas = total produce of apples - 100 kg
= 800 kg - 100 kg
= 700 kg

### Step 4: Calculate the total produce of peaches
Total produce of peaches = total produce of oranges / 2
= 600 kg / 2
= 300 kg

### Step 5: Calculate the total produce of guavas
Total produce of guavas = total produce of mangoes / 4
= 400 kg / 4
= 100 kg

### Step 6: Calculate the total produce of lemons
Total produce of lemons = total produce of peaches + 50 kg
= 300 kg + 50 kg
= 350 kg

### Step 7: Calculate the total produce of all fruits
Total produce of all fruits = sum of all individual produces
= 400 kg (mangoes) + 800 kg (apples) + 600 kg (oranges) + 700 kg (bananas) + 300 kg (peaches) + 100 kg (guavas) + 350 kg (lemons)
= 400 kg + 800 kg + 600 kg + 700 kg + 300 kg + 100 kg + 350 kg

There is a one-time processing fee of $500 for the whole family. John agrees to pay half the total cost for the whole family. How much does John pay for the first year?,35010.0,"To determine how much John pays for the first year, we need to calculate the total cost for all family members and then find out what John's share would be.

### Step 1: Calculate the Monthly Cost Per Person

The monthly cost includes:
- Gym access: $50 per person
- Monthly membership fee: $1000 per person

So, the total monthly cost per person is:
\[ 50 + 1000 = 1050 \text{ dollars} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Annual Maintenance Fee

There is an annual maintenance fee of $600 per person. Since there are 4 people (including John), the total annual maintenance fee is:
\[ 600 \times 4 = 2400 \text{ dollars} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Monthly Cost Including Guest Passes

Each person buys 2 guest passes each month at $30 each. So, the cost for guest passes per person per month is:
\[ 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

Adding this to the regular monthly costs:
\[ 1050 + 60 = 1110 \text{ dollars} \]

Since there are 4 people, the total monthly cost including guest passes for the entire family is:
\[ 1110 \times 4 = 4440 \text{ dollars} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the One-Time Processing Fee

The one-time processing fee for the whole family is $500.

### Step 5: Calculate the Total Annual Cost Before Subtraction

The total annual cost before any deductions is the sum of the annual maintenance fees, the monthly costs, and the processing fee:
\[ 2400 + 4440 + 500 = 7340 \text{ dollars} \]

**Lions in SNP:** 
- SNP has 100 lions.

**Snakes in SNP:** 
- SNP has half as many snakes as lions.
\[
\text{Number of snakes} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
\]

**Giraffes in SNP:** 
- SNP has 10 fewer giraffes than snakes.
\[
\text{Number of giraffes} = 50 - 10 = 40
\]

**Zebras in SNP:** 
- SNP has twice as many zebras as giraffes.
\[
\text{Number of zebras} = 2 \times 40 = 80

**Monkeys in SNP:** 
- SNP has three times as many monkeys as giraffes.
\[
\text{Number of monkeys} = 3 \times 40 = 120
\]

**Crocodiles in SNP:** 
- SNP has one-fifth as many crocodiles as lions.
\[
\text{Number of crocodiles} = \frac{100}{5} = 20

Now, let's sum up all the animals in SNP:
\[
\text{Total animals in SNP} = 100 + 50 + 40 + 80 + 45 + 120 + 20 = 415
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of animals in SNP

**Lions in SNP:** 
- SNP has double as many lions as SNP.
\[
\text{Number of lions} = 2 \times 100 = 200
\]

**Snakes in SNP:** 
- SNP has triple as many snakes as SNP.
\[
\text{Number of snakes} = 3 \times 50 = 150

He buys 5 peacocks that cost 50% less each than a pony. How much did he spend?",10950.0,"To determine how much Tim spent on his zoo purchases, we need to calculate the cost of each type of animal separately and then sum these amounts.

First, let's find the cost of the goats:
- Tim buys 3 goats at $400 each.
\[
\text{Cost of goats} = 3 \times 400 = 1200
\]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the llamas:
- Tim buys twice as many llamas as goats, so he buys \(2 \times 3 = 6\) llamas.
- Each llama costs 50% more than a goat, so each llama costs \(400 + (0.5 \times 400) = 400 + 200 = 600\) dollars.
\[
\text{Cost of llamas} = 6 \times 600 = 3600
\]

Now, let's find the cost of the alpacas:
- Tim buys 4 alpacas, and they cost 25% less than a llama.
- The cost of one llama is $600, so the cost of one alpaca is \(600 - (0.25 \times 600) = 600 - 150 = 450\) dollars.
\[
\text{Cost of alpacas} = 4 \times 450 = 1800
\]

Next, let's determine the cost of the zebras:
- Tim buys 2 zebras, and each zebra costs twice as much as a goat.
- Each goat costs $400, so each zebra costs \(2 \times 400 = 800\) dollars.
\[
\text{Cost of zebras} = 2 \times 800 = 1600
\]

Then, let's calculate the cost of the ponies:
- Tim buys as many ponies as goats, so he buys 3 ponies.
- Each pony costs $100 more than a goat, so each pony costs \(400 + 100 = 500\) dollars.
\[
\text{Cost of ponies} = 3 \times 500 = 1500
\]

Finally, let's find the cost of the peacocks:
- Tim buys 5 peacocks, and each peacock costs 50% less than a pony.
- Each pony costs $500, so each peacock costs \(500 - (0.5 \times 500) = 500 - 250 = 250\) dollars.
\[
\text{Cost of peacocks} = 5 \times 250 = 1250

- Time with reefed sail = 4 hours
- Distance with reefed sail = Speed × Time = 15 knots × 4 hours = 60 nautical miles

### Step 6: Sum Up All Distances

Total distance = Distance with one sail + Distance with two sails + Distance with three sails + Distance with four sails + Distance with reefed sail
= 100 nautical miles + 200 nautical miles + 60 nautical miles + 140 nautical miles + 60 nautical miles
= 560 nautical miles

### Step 7: Convert Nautical Miles to Land Miles

Given that 1 nautical mile = 1.15 land miles,
Total distance in land miles = Total distance in nautical miles × Conversion factor
= 560 nautical miles × 1.15 land miles/nautical mile
= 644 land miles

Therefore, the total distance Buffy will travel is **644** land miles.",644,644.0,False,

How much is Peter's remaining money?",352.0,"To determine how much Peter has left after his purchases, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of item he bought and then subtract this from his initial amount of $500.

First, let's calculate the cost of each type of item:

1. **Potatoes:**
   - Cost per kilogram: $2
   - Total kilograms: 6
   \[
   \text{Total cost of potatoes} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Tomato:**
   - Cost per kilogram: $3
   - Total kilograms: 9
   \[
   \text{Total cost of tomatoes} = 9 \times 3 = 27 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cucumbers:**

First, let's calculate the total cost for Mell:
- Mell ordered 2 cups of coffee and 1 piece of cake.
- The cost of 2 cups of coffee is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.
- The cost of 1 piece of cake is \(7\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for Mell is \(8 + 7 = 15\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for Mell's first friend:
- This friend ordered the same as Mell (2 cups of coffee and 1 piece of cake).
- The total cost for this friend is also \(15\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for Mell's second friend:
- This friend ordered the same as Mell (2 cups of coffee and 1 piece of cake) plus 2 bowls of ice cream.
- The cost of 2 bowls of ice cream is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this friend is \(15 + 6 = 21\) dollars.

Next, let's calculate the total cost for Mell's third friend:
- This friend ordered the same as Mell (2 cups of coffee and 1 piece of cake) plus 2 bowls of ice cream.
- The total cost for this friend is also \(15 + 6 = 21\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate the total cost for Mell's fourth friend:
- This friend ordered 1 cup of coffee and 2 bowls of ice cream.
- The cost of 1 cup of coffee is \(4\) dollars.
- The cost of 2 bowls of ice cream is \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost for this friend is \(4 + 6 = 10\) dollars.

Finally, let's calculate the total cost for Mell's fifth friend:
- This friend ordered 1 cup of coffee and 1 piece of cake.
- The total cost for this friend is \(4 + 7 = 11\) dollars.

4. **Raphael**: Raphael will eat half the amount Manny does, so he will eat \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a piece.
   \[
   \text{Pieces for Raphael} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

5. **Lisa**: Lisa will eat two pieces plus any leftover from Raphael's piece. Since Raphael ate \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a piece, there will be \( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = 0 \) pieces left for Lisa.

Each sector has 10 men and 10 women, so there are 120 employees in total. How much did he spend total on buying t-shirts?",2040.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of each type of shirt (men's or women's) and then sum up the costs for all sectors.

First, let's determine the price of men's t-shirts:

- White men's t-shirts: $20
- Black men's t-shirts: $18

Next, let's find out the price of women's t-shirts based on the given information that they are $5 cheaper than men's t-shirts:

- Blue women's t-shirts: $22 - $5 = $17
- Red women's t-shirts: $21 - $5 = $16
- Green women's t-shirts: $19 - $5 = $14
- Gray women's t-shirts: $17 - $5 = $12

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each sector:

Each sector has 10 men and 10 women, making it 20 people per sector. Since there are 6 sectors, we have:

Total number of men = 6 sectors * 10 men/sector = 60 men
Total number of women = 6 sectors * 10 women/sector = 60 women

Cost calculation for men's t-shirts:

- Total cost for men's t-shirts = (Number of white men's t-shirts + Number of black men's t-shirts) * Price per men's t-shirt
= (2 * $20) + (2 * $18)
= $40 + $36

Cost calculation for women's t-shirts:

- Total cost for women's t-shirts = (Number of blue women's t-shirts + Number of red women's t-shirts + Number of green women's t-shirts + Number of gray women's t-shirts) * Price per women's t-shirt
= ($17 + $16 + $14 + $12) * $5
= $59 * $5
= $295

Finally, let's add up the total cost for both men's and women's t-shirts:

Total cost = Cost for men's t-shirts + Cost for women's t-shirts
