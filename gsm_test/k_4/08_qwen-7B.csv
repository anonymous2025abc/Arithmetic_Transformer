1. Calculate the total amount of rain collected over the week.
2. Convert the total inches of rain into gallons.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling the water.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rain collected over the week.**

- Monday: 4 inches
- Tuesday: 3 inches
- Wednesday: 2 inches
- Thursday: 1 inch
- Friday: 5 inches
- Saturday: 3 inches

Total inches of rain = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 3 = 18 inches

**Step 2: Convert the total inches of rain into gallons.**

Given that 1 inch of rain equals 15.0 gallons, we can calculate the total gallons as follows:

Total gallons = Total inches of rain × Gallons per inch
Total gallons = 18 inches × 15.0 gallons/inch
Total gallons = 270 gallons

**Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the water.**

Given that water is sold for $1.2 per gallon, we can calculate the total revenue as follows:

2. **Bedroom Walls:**
   - Each bedroom wall takes up 400 square feet, and there are 3 bedrooms.
   - Total area for bedrooms = \( 400 \times 3 = 1200 \) square feet

3. **Kitchen Walls:**
   - Each kitchen wall takes up 500 square feet, and there are 6 kitchens.

   - Each bathroom wall takes up 150 square feet, and there are 8 bathrooms.
   - Total area for bathrooms = \( 150 \times 8 = 1200 \) square feet

6. **Garage Walls:**
   - Each garage wall takes up 480 square feet, and there are 5 garages.
   - Total area for garages = \( 480 \times 5 = 2400 \) square feet

\[
600 + 1200 + 3000 + 1200 + 1200 + 2400 = 9600 \text{ square feet}

Since one gallon of paint covers 600 square feet, we divide the total area by the coverage per gallon:

\[

   - \( \text{Age of Carlo Rosi} = 40 \)

2. **Franzia** is three times as old as the Carlo Rosi.
   - \( \text{Age of Franzia} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \)

3. **Twin Valley** is one-fourth the age of the Carlo Rosi.
   - \( \text{Age of Twin Valley} = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \)

4. **Silver Ridge** is the same age as the Franzia.
   - \( \text{Age of Silver Ridge} = 120 \)

5. **Old Vine** is half the age of the Twin Valley.
   - \( \text{Age of Old Vine} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \)

6. **Crestwood** is the same age as the Carlo Rosi.
   - \( \text{Age of Crestwood} = 40 \)

7. **Barrel Hill** is three times the age of the Old Vine.
   - \( \text{Age of Barrel Hill} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \)

Now, we sum up the ages of all the wines:

\[
\text{Total age} = \text{Age of Franzia} + \text{Age of Carlo Rosi} + \text{Age of Twin Valley} + \text{Age of Silver Ridge} + \text{Age of Old Vine} + \text{Age of Crestwood} + \text{Age of Barrel Hill}
\]

Substituting the values we found:

\[
\text{Total age} = 120 + 40 + 10 + 120 + 5 + 40 + 15
\]

Adding these together:

\[
120 + 40 = 160

\[
160 + 10 = 170

Given:
- \( R_J = 30 \)
- \( B_J = 25 \)

Step-by-step calculations:

1. **Mary's Marbles:**
   - \( R_M = 2R_J = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
   - \( B_M = \frac{B_A}{2} \)

Priya brings twice as many treats as Carlos and one-fourth as many pieces of bread as treats. If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",446.0,"Let's start by defining the variables based on the information given:

- Let \( T_J \) be the number of treats Jane brings.
- Let \( B_J \) be the number of pieces of bread Jane brings.
- Let \( T_W \) be the number of treats Wanda brings.
- Let \( B_W \) be the number of pieces of bread Wanda brings.
- Let \( T_C \) be the number of treats Carlos brings.
- Let \( B_C \) be the number of pieces of bread Carlos brings.
- Let \( T_M \) be the number of treats Mia brings.
- Let \( B_M \) be the number of pieces of bread Mia brings.
- Let \( T_O \) be the number of treats Omar brings.
- Let \( B_O \) be the number of pieces of bread Omar brings.
- Let \( T_P \) be the number of treats Priya brings.
- Let \( B_P \) be the number of pieces of bread Priya brings.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( B_W = 90 \)
2. \( B_J = 0.75T_J \)
3. \( T_W = 0.5T_J \)
4. \( B_W = 3T_W \)
5. \( T_C = \frac{1}{3}T_J \)
6. \( B_C = 2T_C \)
7. \( T_M = T_W - 10 \)
8. \( B_M = 0.5T_M \)
9. \( T_O = 1.5T_W \)
10. \( B_O = \frac{4}{5}B_O \)
11. \( T_P = 2T_C \)
12. \( B_P = \frac{1}{4}T_P \)

First, let's find \( T_J \) using the relationship between \( B_W \) and \( T_W \):
\[ B_W = 3T_W \]
Given \( B_W = 90 \):
\[ 90 = 3T_W \]
\[ T_W = 30 \]

Now, use \( T_W \) to find \( T_J \):
\[ T_W = 0.5T_J \]
\[ 30 = 0.5T_J \]
\[ T_J = 60 \]

Next, find \( B_J \):
\[ B_J = 0.75T_J \]
\[ B_J = 0.75 \times 60 \]
\[ B_J = 45 \]

Find \( T_C \):
\[ T_C = \frac{1}{3}T_J \]
\[ T_C = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 \]
\[ T_C = 20 \]

Find \( B_C \):
\[ B_C = 2T_C \]
\[ B_C = 2 \times 20 \]
\[ B_C = 40 \]

Find \( T_M \):
\[ T_M = T_W - 10 \]
\[ T_M = 30 - 10 \]
\[ T_M = 20 \]

Find \( B_M \):
\[ B_M = 0.5T_M \]
\[ B_M = 0.5 \times 20 \]
\[ B_M = 10 \]

Find \( T_O \):
\[ T_O = 1.5T_W \]
\[ T_O = 1.5 \times 30 \]
\[ T_O = 45 \]

Find \( B_O \):
\[ B_O = \frac{4}{5}B_O \]
This seems incorrect; it should be:
\[ B_O = \frac{4}{5}T_O \]
\[ B_O = \frac{4}{5} \times 45 \]
\[ B_O = 36 \]

Find \( T_P \):
\[ T_P = 2T_C \]
\[ T_P = 2 \times 20 \]
\[ T_P = 40 \]

Find \( B_P \):
\[ B_P = \frac{1}{4}T_P \]
\[ B_P = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 \]
\[ B_P = 10 \]

Now, sum up all the treats and pieces of bread:
\[ \text{Treats} = T_J + T_W + T_C + T_M + T_O + T_P \]
\[ \text{Treats} = 60 + 30 + 20 + 20 + 45 + 40 \]
\[ \text{Treats} = 215 \]

\[ \text{Pieces of bread} = B_J + B_W + B_C + B_M + B_O + B_P \]
\[ \text{Pieces of bread} = 45 + 90 + 40 + 10 + 36 + 10 \]
\[ \text{Pieces of bread} = 241 \]

Total number of items:

2. **Jude** visited half as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa.
   \[
   J = \frac{L}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
   \]

3. **Han** visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude.
   \[
   H = 2J - 2 = 2(3) - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4

4. **Jane** visited 6 more than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Han.
   \[

5. **Omar** visited 3 more rehabilitation centers than Jude.
   \[
   O = J + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6

   However, since Omar and Lisa visited the same number of centers (both 6), this contradicts the condition that they are all different. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate if there is any misinterpretation or if the problem has an inherent contradiction. Given the problem constraints, let's assume the problem intends for us to find the total without the contradiction.

6. **Priya** visited 1 less than three times as many rehabilitation centers as Han.
   \[
   P = 3H - 1 = 3(4) - 1 = 12 - 1 = 11

8. **Nia** visited 4 fewer than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jane.
   \[
   N = 2Ja - 4 = 2(14) - 4 = 28 - 4 = 24

Now, summing up the number of rehabilitation centers visited by each person:
\[
L + J + H + Ja + O + P + C + N = 6 + 3 + 4 + 14 + 6 + 11 + 12 + 24

3. **Brushing the dog:**
   - Time spent: 8 minutes

4. **Trimming the dog's nails:**
   - Time spent: Half the time spent brushing = \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) minutes

5. **Driving to the trailhead:**
   - Distance: 9 miles

First, we need to determine how many legs each type of animal has:
- Chimps: 2 legs each
- Lions: 4 legs each
- Lizards: 4 legs each
- Penguins: 2 legs each
- Elephants: 4 legs each
- Parrots: 2 legs each
- Turtles: 4 legs each

Next, we calculate the total number of legs Borgnine has already seen for each type of animal:
- Chimps: \(12 \text{ chimps} \times 2 \text{ legs/chimp} = 24 \text{ legs}\)
- Lions: \(8 \text{ lions} \times 4 \text{ legs/lion} = 32 \text{ legs}\)

Borgnine wants to see a total of 1100 legs. Therefore, the number of additional legs he needs to see is:

2. **Pen**: The pen is shorter than the pencil by 2 cm.

   \[
   \text{Paintbrush} = 10 \text{ cm} + 3 \text{ cm} = 13 \text{ cm}

6. **Crayon**: We need to find the length of the rubber first. Let the length of the rubber be \( r \) cm. The pen is longer than the rubber by 3 cm.
   \[
   \text{Pen} = r + 3 \text{ cm}

   Since we know the pen is 10 cm,

Since their ages are consecutive integers and their sum is 96, we can write the equation:

\[x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 96\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[3x + 3 = 96\]

Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \(x\):

\[3x = 93\]

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \(x\):

\[x = 31\]

So, the ages of the three oldest brothers are 31, 32, and 33.

Next, we need to determine the ages of the younger brothers. Liam is 1 year younger than the youngest of the three oldest brothers, so Liam is:

\[31 - 1 = 30\]

Noah is 1 year younger than Liam, so Noah is:

   - Fernando's time = \(2 \times 20 = 40\) hours.

3. **Gina's Time:**
   - Gina takes half as long as Fernando.
   - Gina's time = \(\frac{40}{2} = 20\) hours.

4. **Harold's Time:**
   - Harold takes 10 hours more than Emma.
   - Harold's time = \(20 + 10 = 30\) hours.

5. **Ivy's Time:**
   - Ivy takes 5 hours less than Fernando.

- Let \( M \) be the total produce of mangoes.
- Given: \( M = 400 \) kg.

Now, let's find the produce for each type of fruit:

1. **Apples (A):**
   - Total produce of apples was twice the total produce of mangoes.
   \[
   A = 2M = 2 \times 400 = 800 \text{ kg}
   \]

2. **Oranges (O):**
   - Total produce of oranges was 200 kg more than that of mangoes.
   \[
   O = M + 200 = 400 + 200 = 600 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. **Bananas (B):**
   - He produced 100 kg fewer bananas than apples.
   \[
   B = A - 100 = 800 - 100 = 700 \text{ kg}
   \]

4. **Peaches (P):**
   - The total produce of peaches was half the total produce of oranges.
   \[
   P = \frac{O}{2} = \frac{600}{2} = 300 \text{ kg}
   \]

5. **Guavas (G):**
   - He harvested one-fourth as many guavas as mangoes.
   \[
   G = \frac{M}{4} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ kg}
   \]

6. **Lemons (L):**
   - The total produce of lemons was 50 kg more than the total produce of peaches.
   \[
   L = P + 50 = 300 + 50 = 350 \text{ kg}
   \]

Next, we sum up the total produce of all the fruits:

\[
\text{Total produce} = A + M + O + B + P + G + L
\]
\[
= 800 + 400 + 600 + 700 + 300 + 100 + 350
\]
\[
= 3050 \text{ kg}

Finally, we calculate the total amount of money he got by selling the fruits at $50 per kg:

\[
\text{Total money} = \text{Total produce} \times \text{Price per kg}

1. **Initial Winnings:**
   - Opal won $100.00.

2. **First Bet:**
   - She put half into savings: \( \frac{100}{2} = 50 \) dollars.
   - She bet the other half: \( 100 - 50 = 50 \) dollars.
   - She made a 60% profit on the $50 bet: \( 50 + (0.60 \times 50) = 50 + 30 = 80 \) dollars.
   - She put half of this into savings: \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \) dollars.
   - She now has \( 50 + 40 = 90 \) dollars in total.

3. **Second Bet:**
   - She bet the remaining $90.
   - She made a 25% profit on the $90 bet: \( 90 + (0.25 \times 90) = 90 + 22.5 = 112.5 \) dollars.
   - She put half of this into savings: \( \frac{112.5}{2} = 56.25 \) dollars.
   - She now has \( 90 + 56.25 = 146.25 \) dollars in total.

4. **Third Bet:**
   - She bet the remaining $146.25.
   - She made a 20% profit on the $146.25 bet: \( 146.25 + (0.20 \times 146.25) = 146.25 + 29.25 = 175.5 \) dollars.
   - She put half of this into savings: \( \frac{175.5}{2} = 87.75 \) dollars.
   - She now has \( 146.25 + 87.75 = 234 \) dollars in total.

5. **Fourth Bet:**
   - She bet the remaining $234.
   - She made a 100% profit on the $234 bet: \( 234 + (1.00 \times 234) = 234 + 234 = 468 \) dollars.
   - She put half of this into savings: \( \frac{468}{2} = 234 \) dollars.
   - She now has \( 234 + 234 = 468 \) dollars in total.

6. **Fifth Bet:**
   - She bet the remaining $468.
   - She made a 60% profit on the $468 bet: \( 468 + (0.60 \times 468) = 468 + 280.8 = 748.8 \) dollars.
   - She put half of this into savings: \( \frac{748.8}{2} = 374.4 \) dollars.
   - She now has \( 468 + 374.4 = 842.4 \) dollars in total.

How much money did Mell and her friends need to pay at the cafeteria?",144.0,"Let's break down the orders and calculate the total cost step by step.

1. **Mell's Order:**
   - 2 cups of coffee: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars
   - 1 piece of cake: \(7\) dollars
   - Total for Mell: \(8 + 7 = 15\) dollars

2. **Each of the first two friends' order (same as Mell):**
   - 2 cups of coffee: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars
   - 1 piece of cake: \(7\) dollars
   - Total for each: \(8 + 7 = 15\) dollars
   - For both friends: \(15 \times 2 = 30\) dollars

3. **Nina's Order (same as Mell plus 2 bowls of ice cream):**
   - 2 cups of coffee: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars
   - 1 piece of cake: \(7\) dollars
   - 2 bowls of ice cream: \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars
   - Total for Nina: \(8 + 7 + 6 = 21\) dollars

4. **Each of the next two friends' order (1 cup of coffee and 2 bowls of ice cream):**
   - 1 cup of coffee: \(4\) dollars
   - 2 bowls of ice cream: \(2 \times 3 = 6\) dollars
   - Total for each: \(4 + 6 = 10\) dollars
   - For both friends: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) dollars

5. **Omar's Order (3 cups of coffee and 1 piece of cake):**
   - 3 cups of coffee: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) dollars
   - 1 piece of cake: \(7\) dollars
   - Total for Omar: \(12 + 7 = 19\) dollars

6. **Each of the last three friends' order (1 cup of coffee and 1 piece of cake):**

He needs to know how many pieces to cut the lasagna into to serve it. Manny only wants one piece. Aaron doesn't like lasagna much and will probably only eat garlic bread and salad. Kai is always hungry and will eat twice as much as Manny. Raphael always eats half the amount Manny does, but his sister Lisa loves lasagna and will eat two pieces, plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Another friend, Nora, is picky and will only eat one-third of what Manny eats, and Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. Another friend, Ben, will eat the same amount of lasagna as Kai. Another friend, Tina, loves lasagna and will eat 3 pieces. Another friend, Omar, will eat half as much as Kai. How many pieces should Manny cut his lasagna into?",13.0,"Let's break down the lasagna consumption step by step:

1. **Manny**: 1 piece
2. **Aaron**: 0 pieces (only eats garlic bread and salad)
3. **Kai**: 2 pieces (twice as much as Manny)
4. **Raphael**: 0.5 piece (half the amount Manny does)
5. **Lisa**: 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 pieces (two pieces plus what Raphael has left)
6. **Nora**: \(\frac{1}{3}\) piece (one-third of what Manny eats)
7. **Ben**: 2 pieces (same as Kai)
8. **Tina**: 3 pieces
9. **Omar**: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1\) piece (half as much as Kai)

Now, let's sum up all the pieces:

- Manny: 1
- Aaron: 0
- Kai: 2
- Raphael: 0.5
- Lisa: 2.5
- Nora: \(\frac{1}{3}\)
- Ben: 2
- Tina: 3
- Omar: 1

Adding these together:

\[ 1 + 0 + 2 + 0.5 + 2.5 + \frac{1}{3} + 2 + 3 + 1 \]

First, add the whole numbers:

\[ 1 + 2 + 0.5 + 2.5 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 11 \]

Next, add the fraction:

\[ 11 + \frac{1}{3} = 11 \frac{1}{3} \]

To make it easier to cut, we can convert \(11 \frac{1}{3}\) to an improper fraction or a decimal:

\[ 11 \frac{1}{3} = \frac{34}{3} \approx 11.33 \]

Since we need to cut the lasagna into whole pieces, we round up to the nearest whole number because you can't serve a fraction of a piece.

Therefore, Manny should cut the lasagna into 12 pieces.

Each sector has 10 men and 10 women, so there are 120 employees in total. How much did he spend total on buying t-shirts?",2040.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the t-shirts Juan bought for his employees. We will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of women's t-shirts:**
   - White women's t-shirts: \( \$20 - \$5 = \$15 \)
   - Black women's t-shirts: \( \$18 - \$5 = \$13 \)
   - Blue women's t-shirts: \( \$22 - \$5 = \$17 \)
   - Red women's t-shirts: \( \$21 - \$5 = \$16 \)
   - Green women's t-shirts: \( \$19 - \$5 = \$14 \)
   - Gray women's t-shirts: \( \$17 - \$5 = \$12 \)

2. **Calculate the cost for each sector:**
   - Each sector has 10 men and 10 women.
   - Cost for one sector (men):
     - White: \( 10 \times \$20 = \$200 \)
     - Black: \( 10 \times \$18 = \$180 \)
     - Blue: \( 10 \times \$22 = \$220 \)

How many fish do all the people mentioned have put together?,265.0,"Let's start by determining the number of fish each person has based on the information given.

1. **Billy** has 10 fish.
   - \( B = 10 \)

2. **Nina** has 2 fewer fish than Billy.
   - \( N = B - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8 \)

3. **Priya** has 4 times as many fish as Nina.
   - \( P = 4N = 4 \times 8 = 32 \)

4. **Chen** has 10 more fish than Sarah.
   - We need to find out how many fish Sarah has first.

5. **Tony** has 3 times as many fish as Billy.
   - \( T = 3B = 3 \times 10 = 30 \)

6. **Sarah** has 5 more fish than Tony.
   - \( S = T + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35 \)

7. **Chen** has 10 more fish than Sarah.
   - \( C = S + 10 = 35 + 10 = 45 \)

8. **Bobby** has twice as many fish as Sarah.

   - Given: \( R = 16 \)

2. **Blue Gumballs (B):**
   - The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs.
   - Therefore, \( B = \frac{1}{2}R = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8 \)

3. **Green Gumballs (G):**
   - For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs.
   - Therefore, \( G = 4B = 4 \times 8 = 32 \)

4. **Yellow Gumballs (Y):**
   - The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs.
   - Therefore, \( Y = B = 8 \)

5. **Purple Gumballs (P):**
   - The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs.

6. **Orange Gumballs (O):**
   - The machine has twice as many orange gumballs as blue gumballs.
   - Therefore, \( O = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \)

7. **Pink Gumballs (K):**
   - The machine has one-fourth as many pink gumballs as green gumballs.
   - Therefore, \( K = \frac{1}{4}G = \frac{1}{4} \times 32 = 8 \)

Now, we sum up all the gumballs to find the total number of gumballs in the machine:
