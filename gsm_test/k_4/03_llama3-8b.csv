There were also two-thirds as many monkeys as rabbits and leopards combined. What is the total number of animals that Josie counted?",1041.0,"0.5

Explanation:
Let the number of antelopes be x.
The number of rabbits is x + 34.
The number of hyenas is x + x + 34 - 42 = 2x + 32.
The number of wild dogs is 2x + 32 + 50 = 2x + 82.
The number of leopards is (x + 34)/2 = (x + 34)/2.
The number of zebras is 2(x + 34)/2 = x + 34.
The number of giraffes is x + 34 - 3 = x + 31.
The number of buffaloes is (x + x + 34)/2 = x + 17.
The number of monkeys is (x + 34 + x + 34)/2 = 2x + 68.
The total number of animals is x + x + 34 + 2x + 32 + 2x + 82 + (x + 34)/2 + x + 34 + x + 31 + (x + x + 34)/2 + 2x + 68 = 6x + 340.

3,llama3-8b,meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B,4,19,18,"From Monday to Friday, Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny and half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie, who collected 20 more red marbles than Mary and twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected. Tom collected three times as many red marbles as Mary. Tom collected 5 fewer blue marbles than Jenny. Sara collected 10 fewer red marbles than Anie. Sara collected five times as many blue marbles as Mary. Leo collected three times as many red marbles as Jenny. Leo collected three times as many blue marbles as Jenny. Maya collected five times as many red marbles as Tom. Maya collected 3 fewer blue marbles than Sara. If Jenny collected 30 red marbles and 25 blue marbles, what's the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together?",442.0,"0.5

Explanation:
Let's start by assigning variables to the number of red and blue marbles collected by each friend. We'll use the following variables:
• Rm = number of red marbles collected by Mary
• Rj = number of red marbles collected by Jenny
• Rl = number of red marbles collected by Leo
• Rt = number of red marbles collected by Tom
• Ra = number of red marbles collected by Anie
• Rs = number of red marbles collected by Sara
• Rm = number of blue marbles collected by Mary
• Rj = number of blue marbles collected by Jenny
• Rl = number of blue marbles collected by Leo
• Rt = number of blue marbles collected by Tom
• Ra = number of blue marbles collected by Anie
• Rs = number of blue marbles collected by Sara
• Rm = number of blue marbles collected by Maya
Now, we can start solving the problem. We'll start by writing down the information we have about the number of red marbles collected by each friend:
• Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny: Rm = 2Rj
• Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary: Ra = Rm + 20
• Tom collected three times as many red marbles as Mary: Rt = 3Rm
• Sara collected 10 fewer red marbles than Anie: Rs = Ra - 10
• Leo collected three times as many red marbles as Jenny: Rl = 3Rj
• Maya collected five times as many red marbles as Tom: Rm = 5Rt
• Jenny collected 30 red marbles: Rj = 30
Now, we can write down the information we have about the number of blue marbles collected by each friend:
• Mary collected half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie: Rm = 0.5Ra
• Tom collected 5 fewer blue marbles than Jenny: Rt = Rj - 5
• Sara collected five times as many blue marbles as Mary: Rs = 5Rm
• Leo collected three times as many blue marbles as Jenny: Rl = 3Rj
• Maya collected 3 fewer blue marbles than Sara: Rm = Rs - 3
• Jenny collected 25 blue marbles: Rj = 25
Now, we can start solving the problem. We'll start by solving for the number of red marbles collected by each friend:
• Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny: Rm = 2Rj
• Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary: Ra = Rm + 20
• Tom collected three times as many red marbles as Mary: Rt = 3Rm
• Sara collected 10 fewer red marbles than Anie: Rs = Ra - 10
• Leo collected three times as many red marbles as Jenny: Rl = 3Rj
• Maya collected five times as many red marbles as Tom: Rm = 5Rt
• Jenny collected 30 red marbles: Rj = 30
Now, we can solve for the number of blue marbles collected by each friend:
• Mary collected half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie: Rm = 0.5Ra
• Tom collected 5 fewer blue marbles than Jenny: Rt = Rj - 5
• Sara collected five times as many blue marbles as Mary: Rs = 5Rm
• Leo collected three times as many blue marbles as Jenny: Rl = 3Rj
• Maya collected 3 fewer blue marbles than Sara: Rm = Rs - 3
• Jenny collected 25 blue marbles: Rj = 25
Now, we can solve for the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together:
• Mary collected half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie: Rm = 0.5Ra
• Tom collected 5 fewer blue marbles than Jenny: Rt = Rj - 5
• Sara collected five times as many blue marbles as Mary: Rs = 5Rm
• Leo collected three times as many blue marbles as Jenny: Rl = 3Rj
• Maya collected 3 fewer blue marbles than Sara: Rm = Rs - 3
• Jenny collected 25 blue marbles: Rj = 25
Now, we can solve for the total number of blue marbles collected by the friends together:
• Mary collected half the number of blue marbles collected by Anie: Rm = 0.5Ra
• Tom collected 5 fewer blue marbles than Jenny: Rt = Rj - 5
• Sara collected five times as many blue marbles as Mary",5,5.0,False,

If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",446.0,"1, 100

Explanation:

Let x be the number of treats that Jane brought to the zoo. Then, the number of pieces of bread that Jane brought to the zoo is 0.75x.

Let y be the number of treats that Wanda brought to the zoo. Then, the number of pieces of bread that Wanda brought to the zoo is 0.5x.

Let z be the number of treats that Carlos brought to the zoo. Then, the number of pieces of bread that Carlos brought to the zoo is 2z.

Let a be the number of treats that Mia brought to the zoo. Then, the number of pieces of bread that Mia brought to the zoo is 0.5a.

Let c be the number of treats that Priya brought to the zoo. Then, the number of pieces of bread that Priya brought to the zoo is 0.25c.

We are given that Wanda brought 90 pieces of bread. Therefore, we have the following system of equations:

0.5x + 0.75x + 2z + 0.5a + 0.8b + 0.25c = 90

x + 0.75x + 2z + 0.5a + 0.8b + 0.25c = 180

Han visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude did. Jude visited half as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa did. Omar visited 3 more rehabilitation centers than Jude did. Priya visited 1 less than three times as many rehabilitation centers as Han did. Chen visited twice as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa did. Nia visited 4 fewer than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jane did. If Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers, how many rehabilitation centers did they all visit in total, assuming they are all different?",80.0,"0

Explanation:

Let's start by assigning variables to each person's number of rehabilitation centers visited. We'll use the following variables:

J = Jane's number of rehabilitation centers visited
H = Han's number of rehabilitation centers visited
J = Jude's number of rehabilitation centers visited
L = Lisa's number of rehabilitation centers visited
O = Omar's number of rehabilitation centers visited
P = Priya's number of rehabilitation centers visited
C = Chen's number of rehabilitation centers visited
N = Nia's number of rehabilitation centers visited

We can now write the following equations:

J = 6 + 2H
H = 2J - 2
J = 0.5L
O = J + 3
P = 3H - 1
C = 2L
N = 2J - 4

We can now substitute the equations for H, J, and L into the equation for P:

P = 3(2J - 2) - 1
P = 6J - 6 - 1
P = 6J - 7

We can now substitute the equation for P into the equation for N:

N = 2(6J - 7) - 4
N = 12J - 14 - 4
N = 12J - 18

We can now substitute the equation for N into the equation for C:

C = 2(12J - 18)
C = 24J - 36

We can now substitute the equation for C into the equation for O:

O = (24J - 36) + 3
O = 24J - 33

We can now substitute the equation for O into the equation for J:

J = 0.5(24J - 33) + 3
J = 12J - 16.5 + 3
J = 12J - 13.5

We can now substitute the equation for J into the equation for H:

H = 2(12J - 13.5) - 2
H = 24J - 27 - 2
H = 24J - 29

We can now substitute the equation for H into the equation for J:

J = 6 + 2(24J - 29)
J = 6 + 48J - 58
J = 48J - 52

We can now substitute the equation for J into the equation for L:

L = 2(48J - 52)
L = 96J - 104

We can now substitute the equation for L into the equation for C:

C = 2(96J - 104)
C = 192J - 208

We can now substitute the equation for C into the equation for O:

O = (192J - 208) + 3
O = 192J - 205

We can now substitute the equation for O into the equation for J:

J = 0.5(192J - 205) + 3
J = 96J - 102.5 + 3
J = 96J - 99.5

We can now substitute the equation for J into the equation for H:

H = 2(96J - 99.5) - 2
H = 192J - 199 - 2
H = 192J - 201

We can now substitute the equation for H into the equation for J:

J = 6 + 2(192J - 201)
J = 6 + 384J - 402
J = 384J - 396

We can now substitute the equation for J into the equation for L:

L = 2(384J - 396)
L = 768J - 792

We can now substitute the equation for L into the equation for C:

C = 2(768J - 792)
C = 1536J - 1584

We can now substitute the equation for C into the equation for O:

O = (1536J - 1584) + 3
O = 1536J - 1581

We can now substitute the equation for O into the equation for J:

J = 0.5(1536J - 1581) + 3
J = 768J - 784.5 + 3
J = 768J - 781.5

We can now substitute the equation for J into the equation for H:

H = 2(768J - 781.5) - 2
H = 1536J - 1563 - 2
H = 1536J - 1565

We can now substitute the equation for H into the equation for J:

She'll have 10 times as many bananas as she ate last night, so she'll have 1 + 10 = 11 bananas last night.
She'll have twice as many oranges as apples she'll have today, so she'll have 2x oranges last night.
She'll have 2 fewer pears than the number of apples she'll have today, so she'll have x - 2 pears last night.
She'll have three times as many peaches as she ate last night, so she'll have 3 peaches last night.

Peter's total money is $500.
He bought 6 kilos of potatoes for $2 per kilo, 9 kilos of tomato for $3 per kilo, 5 kilos of cucumbers for $4 per kilo, and 3 kilos of bananas for $5 per kilo.
6 kilos of potatoes x $2 per kilo = $12
9 kilos of tomato x $3 per kilo = $27
5 kilos of cucumbers x $4 per kilo = $20
3 kilos of bananas x $5 per kilo = $15
Total cost of vegetables = $12 + $27 + $20 + $15 = $74
He also bought 4 kilos of rice for $6 per kilo, 2 kilos of onions for $3 per kilo, 5 kilos of apples for $4 per kilo, 3 kilos of chicken for $8 per kilo.

If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",101.0,"64

Explanation:
Let the number of red gumballs be x.
The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs.
The number of blue gumballs is x/2.
For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs.
The number of green gumballs is 4x.
The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs.
The number of yellow gumballs is x/2.
The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs.
The number of purple gumballs is x-3.
The machine has twice as many orange gumballs as blue gumballs.
The number of orange gumballs is 2x/2.
The machine has one-fourth as many pink gumballs as green gumballs.
The number of pink gumballs is x/4.
The total number of gumballs is the sum of the number of red, blue, green, yellow, purple, orange, and pink gumballs.
The total number of gumballs is x+x/2+4x+x/2+x-3+2x/2+x/4.
The total number of gumballs is 8x-3.
The machine has 16 red gumballs.
