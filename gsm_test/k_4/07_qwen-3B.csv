If her final stage performance is 6 minutes long, what is the total combined amount of time, in minutes, that she spends practicing, throwing tantrums, singing, warm-up, costume changes, interviews and meet-and-greet in the final stage performance?",96.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time spent on each activity based on the given information and then sum these times.

Let's denote the duration of the final stage performance as \( t \) minutes. According to the problem, \( t = 6 \) minutes.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Time spent singing:**
   - Carlotta sings for \( t \) minutes.
   - Given \( t = 6 \) minutes, the time spent singing is:
     \[
     \text{Time spent singing} = 6 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Time spent practicing:**
   - For every 1 minute of singing, Carlotta spends 3 minutes practicing.
   - Therefore, the time spent practicing is:
     \[
     \text{Time spent practicing} = 3 \times \text{Time spent singing} = 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Time spent throwing tantrums:**
   - For every 1 minute of singing, Carlotta spends 5 minutes throwing tantrums.
   - Therefore, the time spent throwing tantrums is:
     \[
     \text{Time spent throwing tantrums} = 5 \times \text{Time spent singing} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Time spent warm-up:**
   - Carlotta spends 1 minute warming up for each minute of singing.
   - Therefore, the time spent warming up is:
     \[
     \text{Time spent warming up} = 1 \times \text{Time spent singing} = 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Time spent costume changes:**
   - Carlotta spends 1 minute changing costumes for each minute of singing.
   - Therefore, the time spent changing costumes is:
     \[
     \text{Time spent changing costumes} = 1 \times \text{Time spent singing} = 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Time spent interviews:**
   - Carlotta spends 2 minutes on interviews for each minute of singing.
   - Therefore, the time spent on interviews is:
     \[
     \text{Time spent on interviews} = 2 \times \text{Time spent singing} = 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ minutes}
     \]

7. **Time spent meet-and-greet:**
   - Carlotta spends 3 minutes meeting and greeting fans for each minute of singing.
   - Therefore, the time spent meeting and greeting is:
     \[
     \text{Time spent meeting and greeting} = 3 \times \text{Time spent singing} = 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ minutes}
     \]

### Total Combined Time:

Now, we sum all the individual times calculated above:
\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time spent singing} + \text{Time spent practicing} + \text{Time spent throwing tantrums} + \text{Time spent warming up} + \text{Time spent changing costumes} + \text{Time spent on interviews} + \text{Time spent meeting and greeting}
\]
\[
\text{Total time} = 6 + 18 + 30 + 6 + 6 + 12 + 18

Adding these values together:
\[
6 + 18 = 24

She also takes as many allergy as anticonvulsants pills each day. She also takes as many thyroid as cholesterol pills each day. How many pills does Holly take in a week?",217.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pills Holly takes each day and then multiply that by 7 to find out how many pills she takes in a week.

Let's break down the information given:

1. **Insulin Pills**: Holly takes 2 pills per day.
2. **Blood Pressure Pills**: Holly takes 3 pills per day.
3. **Anticonvulsant Pills**: Holly takes twice as many anticonvulsant pills as blood pressure pills. Since she takes 3 blood pressure pills per day, she takes \(2 \times 3 = 6\) anticonvulsant pills per day.
4. **Vitamin C Pills**: Holly takes as many vitamin C pills as insulin pills. Since she takes 2 insulin pills per day, she takes 2 vitamin C pills per day.
5. **Cholesterol Pills**: Holly takes twice as many cholesterol pills as blood pressure pills. Since she takes 3 blood pressure pills per day, she takes \(2 \times 3 = 6\) cholesterol pills per day.
6. **Allergy Pills**: Holly takes as many allergy pills as anticonvulsant pills. Since she takes 6 anticonvulsant pills per day, she takes 6 allergy pills per day.
7. **Thyroid Pills**: Holly takes as many thyroid pills as cholesterol pills. Since she takes 6 cholesterol pills per day, she takes 6 thyroid pills per day.

Now, let's sum up the total number of pills Holly takes each day:

\[
\text{Total pills per day} = (\text{Insulin}) + (\text{Blood Pressure}) + (\text{Anticonvulsant}) + (\text{Vitamin C}) + (\text{Cholesterol}) + (\text{Allergy}) + (\text{Thyroid})
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total pills per day} = 2 + 3 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 6 + 6

Adding these together:

\[
2 + 3 = 5
\]
\[

If one gallon of paint covers 600 square feet, how many gallons of paint does Henrietta need to paint her house?",16.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total wall area that needs to be painted and then determine how many gallons of paint are required based on the coverage of one gallon.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Living Room Walls:**
   - Area: 600 square feet

2. **Bedroom Walls:**
   - Each bedroom wall area: 400 square feet
   - Number of bedrooms: 3
   - Total bedroom wall area: \( 400 \text{ sq ft/bedroom} \times 3 \text{ bedrooms} = 1200 \text{ sq ft} \)

3. **Kitchen Walls:**
   - Each kitchen wall area: 500 square feet
   - Number of kitchens: 6
   - Total kitchen wall area: \( 500 \text{ sq ft/kitchen} \times 6 \text{ kitchens} = 3000 \text{ sq ft} \)

4. **Dining Room Walls:**
   - Each dining room wall area: 240 square feet
   - Number of dining rooms: 5
   - Total dining room wall area: \( 240 \text{ sq ft/dining room} \times 5 \text{ dining rooms} = 1200 \text{ sq ft} \)

5. **Bathroom Walls:**
   - Each bathroom wall area: 150 square feet
   - Number of bathrooms: 8
   - Total bathroom wall area: \( 150 \text{ sq ft/bathroom} \times 8 \text{ bathrooms} = 1200 \text{ sq ft} \)

6. **Garage Walls:**
   - Each garage wall area: 480 square feet
   - Number of garages: 5
   - Total garage wall area: \( 480 \text{ sq ft/garage} \times 5 \text{ garages} = 2400 \text{ sq ft} \)

### Total Wall Area Calculation:
Now, sum up all the areas calculated above:
\[
600 \text{ sq ft (living room)} + 1200 \text{ sq ft (bedrooms)} + 3000 \text{ sq ft (kitchens)} + 1200 \text{ sq ft (dining rooms)} + 1200 \text{ sq ft (bathrooms)} + 2400 \text{ sq ft (garages)}
\]

\[
= 600 + 1200 + 3000 + 1200 + 1200 + 2400 = 9600 \text{ sq ft}
\]

### Paint Coverage:
One gallon of paint covers 600 square feet.

### Calculate Required Gallons of Paint:
To find out how many gallons of paint are needed, divide the total wall area by the coverage per gallon:
\[
\frac{9600 \text{ sq ft}}{600 \text{ sq ft/gallon}} = 16 \text{ gallons}
\]

How much did he spend for the night?,467.85,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into several steps and calculate the total cost including the tip.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Entry Fee:**
   - The club charges $20 to enter.
   \[
   \text{Entry Fee} = \$20
   \]

2. **Drinks for Friends:**
   - James buys 2 rounds for his 5 friends.
   - Each round consists of 5 drinks.
   - Cost per drink is $6.
   \[
   \text{Total drinks for friends} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ drinks}

   - Shots: 9 shots at $3.5 each
   \[
   \text{Cost for shots} = 9 \times \$3.5 = \$31.5
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for food} = \$14 + \$16 + \$12 + \$175 + \$31.5 = \$248.5

On Wednesday she rode 25 kilometers and on Thursday she rode 65 kilometers. On Friday she rode 30 kilometers. On Saturday she rode 50% fewer kilometers than Thursday. On Sunday she rode as many kilometers as the sum of the kilometers from Monday and Saturday. On Next Monday she rode 60 kilometers. How many kilometers did Natalia ride in total?,375.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Natalia rode over the specified days and then sum these distances.

First, let's list out the distances she rode each day:

- **Monday**: 40 kilometers
- **Tuesday**: 50 kilometers
- **Wednesday**: 25 kilometers
- **Thursday**: 65 kilometers
- **Friday**: 30 kilometers
- **Saturday**: 50% fewer kilometers than Thursday
- **Sunday**: As many kilometers as the sum of the kilometers from Monday and Saturday
- **Next Monday**: 60 kilometers

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Calculate the distance ridden on Saturday:**
   - Distance on Thursday = 65 kilometers
   - 50% fewer kilometers than Thursday means she rode \( 65 \times (1 - 0.5) = 65 \times 0.5 = 32.5 \) kilometers.
   - Therefore, on Saturday, Natalia rode 32.5 kilometers.

2. **Calculate the distance ridden on Sunday:**
   - Distance on Monday = 40 kilometers
   - Distance on Saturday = 32.5 kilometers
   - Sum of Monday and Saturday = \( 40 + 32.5 = 72.5 \) kilometers
   - Therefore, on Sunday, Natalia rode 72.5 kilometers.

3. **Distance ridden on Next Monday:**
   - Given that she rode 60 kilometers on Next Monday.

Now, let's sum up all the distances:

- **Monday**: 40 kilometers
- **Tuesday**: 50 kilometers
- **Wednesday**: 25 kilometers
- **Thursday**: 65 kilometers
- **Friday**: 30 kilometers
- **Saturday**: 32.5 kilometers
- **Sunday**: 72.5 kilometers
- **Next Monday**: 60 kilometers

Summing these values:
\[
40 + 50 + 25 + 65 + 30 + 32.5 + 72.5 + 60
\]

Let's add them step by step:
\[
40 + 50 = 90
\]
\[
90 + 25 = 115
\]
\[
115 + 65 = 180
\]
\[
180 + 30 = 210
\]
\[
210 + 32.5 = 242.5
\]
\[
242.5 + 72.5 = 315
\]
\[
315 + 60 = 375

Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda and half as many pieces of bread as treats. Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda and four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats. Priya brings twice as many treats as Carlos and one-fourth as many pieces of bread as treats. If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",446.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pieces of bread and treats each person brings to the zoo based on the given information and then sum these quantities.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of treats Wanda brings:**
   - We know that Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread.
   - According to the problem, Wanda brings half as many treats as she brings pieces of bread.
   \[
   \text{Treats Wanda brings} = \frac{90}{2} = 45
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of treats and pieces of bread for each person:**

   - **Jane:**
     - Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats.
     \[
     \text{Pieces of bread Jane brings} = 0.75 \times 45 = 33.75
     \]
     - Since the number of pieces of bread must be an integer, let's assume Jane brings 34 pieces of bread (rounding to the nearest whole number).
     \[
     \text{Treats Jane brings} = \frac{34}{0.75} = 45.33 \approx 45 \text{ (assuming rounding to the nearest whole number)}
     \]

   - **Wanda:**
     - We already determined that Wanda brings 45 treats and 90 pieces of bread.

   - **Carlos:**
     - Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane.
     \[
     \text{Treats Carlos brings} = \frac{45}{3} = 15
     \]
     - Carlos brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats.
     \[
     \text{Pieces of bread Carlos brings} = 2 \times 15 = 30
     \]

   - **Mia:**
     - Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda.
     \[
     \text{Treats Mia brings} = 45 - 10 = 35
     \]
     - Mia brings half as many pieces of bread as treats.
     \[
     \text{Pieces of bread Mia brings} = \frac{35}{2} = 17.5 \approx 18 \text{ (assuming rounding to the nearest whole number)}
     \]

   - **Omar:**
     - Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda.
     \[
     \text{Treats Omar brings} = 1.5 \times 45 = 67.5 \approx 68 \text{ (assuming rounding to the nearest whole number)}
     \]
     - Omar brings four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats.
     \[
     \text{Pieces of bread Omar brings} = \frac{4}{5} \times 68 = 54.4 \approx 54 \text{ (assuming rounding to the nearest whole number)}
     \]

   - **Priya:**
     - Priya brings twice as many treats as Carlos.
     \[
     \text{Treats Priya brings} = 2 \times 15 = 30
     \]
     - Priya brings one-fourth as many pieces of bread as treats.
     \[
     \text{Pieces of bread Priya brings} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \approx 8 \text{ (assuming rounding to the nearest whole number)}
     \]

3. **Sum up all the pieces of bread and treats:**

   - **Total pieces of bread:**
     \[
     34 + 90 + 30 + 18 + 54 + 8 = 244
     \]

   - **Total treats:**
     \[
     45 + 45 + 15 + 35 + 68 + 30 = 228

7. **Priya's Rehabilitation Centers:**
   - Priya visited 1 less than three times as many rehabilitation centers as Han.
   \[
   P = 3H - 1 = 3 \times 4 - 1 = 12 - 1 = 11

Now we have the number of rehabilitation centers each person visited:

- Lisa: \( L = 6 \)
- Chen: \( C = 12 \)
- Jude: \( J = 3 \)
- Omar: \( O = 6 \)
- Han: \( H = 4 \)
- Jane: \( Jn = 14 \)
- Priya: \( P = 11 \)

To find the total number of rehabilitation centers visited by all of them, we sum these values:

If Marcus walks at 6 miles per hour, how much time does he spend with his dog total?",96.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Marcus spends on each activity related to his dog and then sum these times.

1. **Bathing the Dog:**
   Marcus spends 20 minutes giving his dog a bath.

2. **Blow-Drying the Dog:**
   Marcus spends half as long blow-drying his dog as he did bathing her. Therefore, the time spent blow-drying is:

   \]

5. **Driving to the Trailhead:**
   Marcus drives 9 miles to the trailhead at a speed of 30 miles per hour. The time taken to drive is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{9 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.3 \text{ hours} = 0.3 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 18 \text{ minutes}

6. **Filling the Water Bowl and Giving a Treat:**
   Marcus spends 6 minutes filling his dog's water bowl and giving her a treat.

7. **Walking the Dog:**
   Marcus walks a 3-mile trail at a speed of 6 miles per hour. The time taken to walk is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} = 0.5 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}

How many crayons are there in total?,186.0,"To solve this problem, we will calculate the total number of each color of crayon and then sum them up.

1. **Orange Crayons:**
   - Number of boxes: 6
   - Crayons per box: 8
   - Total orange crayons = \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \)

2. **Blue Crayons:**
   - Number of boxes: 7
   - Crayons per box: 5
   - Total blue crayons = \( 7 \times 5 = 35 \)

3. **Red Crayons:**
   - Number of boxes: 1
   - Crayons per box: 11
   - Total red crayons = \( 1 \times 11 = 11 \)

4. **Green Crayons:**

7. **Brown Crayons:**
   - Number of boxes: 5
   - Crayons per box: 4
   - Total brown crayons = \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \)

Now, we sum up all the crayons:

\[
48 \text{ (orange)} + 35 \text{ (blue)} + 11 \text{ (red)} + 24 \text{ (green)} + 18 \text{ (purple)} + 30 \text{ (yellow)} + 20 \text{ (brown)}
\]

Let's add these step-by-step:

\[
48 + 35 = 83
\]
\[
83 + 11 = 94
\]
\[
94 + 24 = 118

He also saw 12 parrots. He also saw 4 turtles. He is next headed to see the tarantulas. How many tarantulas does he need to see to meet his goal?",118.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs Borgnine has already seen and then determine how many more legs he needs to reach his goal of 1100 legs.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of legs for each animal Borgnine has already seen:

- **Chimps**: Each chimp has 2 legs.
  \[
  12 \text{ chimps} \times 2 \text{ legs/chimp} = 24 \text{ legs}
  \]

- **Lions**: Each lion has 4 legs.
  \[
  8 \text{ lions} \times 4 \text{ legs/lion} = 32 \text{ legs}
  \]

- **Lizards**: Each lizard has 4 legs.
  \[
  5 \text{ lizards} \times 4 \text{ legs/lizard} = 20 \text{ legs}
  \]

- **Penguins**: Each penguin has 2 legs.
  \[
  8 \text{ penguins} \times 2 \text{ legs/penguin} = 16 \text{ legs}
  \]

- **Elephants**: Each elephant has 4 legs.
  \[
  4 \text{ elephants} \times 4 \text{ legs/elephant} = 16 \text{ legs}
  \]

- **Parrots**: Each parrot has 2 legs.
  \[
  12 \text{ parrots} \times 2 \text{ legs/parrot} = 24 \text{ legs}
  \]

- **Turtles**: Each turtle has 4 legs.
  \[
  4 \text{ turtles} \times 4 \text{ legs/turtle} = 16 \text{ legs}
  \]

### Step 2: Sum up the total number of legs Borgnine has already seen:

\[
24 \text{ (chimps)} + 32 \text{ (lions)} + 20 \text{ (lizards)} + 16 \text{ (penguins)} + 16 \text{ (elephants)} + 24 \text{ (parrots)} + 16 \text{ (turtles)}
\]

\[
= 24 + 32 + 20 + 16 + 16 + 24 + 16 = 148 \text{ legs}
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many more legs Borgnine needs to see to reach his goal of 1100 legs:

\[
1100 \text{ legs} - 148 \text{ legs} = 952 \text{ legs}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of tarantulas needed to meet the remaining leg requirement:

Each tarantula has 8 legs.

\[
\frac{952 \text{ legs}}{8 \text{ legs/tarantula}} = 119 \text{ tarantulas}

If each competitor was asked a different question, how many questions were asked in the competition?",139.0,"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of questions asked in the competition by calculating the number of questions each competitor answered correctly and incorrectly.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine Drew's performance:**
   - Drew got 20 questions correct.
   - Drew got 6 questions wrong.
   - Total questions for Drew = Correct + Wrong = 20 + 6 = 26 questions.

2. **Determine Carla's performance:**
   - Carla got 14 questions correct.
   - Carla got twice as many questions wrong as Drew.
     \[
     \text{Wrong for Carla} = 2 \times \text{Wrong for Drew} = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]
   - Total questions for Carla = Correct + Wrong = 14 + 12 = 26 questions.

3. **Determine Maya's performance:**
   - Maya got 3 fewer questions correct than Drew.
     \[
     \text{Correct for Maya} = \text{Correct for Drew} - 3 = 20 - 3 = 17
     \]
   - Maya got 2 more questions wrong than Drew.
     \[
     \text{Wrong for Maya} = \text{Wrong for Drew} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8

Savanna National park has twice as many crocodiles as Safari National park. How many animals in total does Savanna National park have?",705.0,"Let's break down the information given for Safari National Park first:

1. **Lions**: 100
2. **Snakes**: Half as many as lions, so \( \frac{100}{2} = 50 \)
3. **Giraffes**: 10 fewer than snakes, so \( 50 - 10 = 40 \)
4. **Zebras**: Twice as many as giraffes, so \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \)
5. **Elephants**: 5 fewer than snakes, so \( 50 - 5 = 45 \)
6. **Monkeys**: Three times as many as giraffes, so \( 3 \times 40 = 120 \)
7. **Crocodiles**: One-fifth as many as lions, so \( \frac{100}{5} = 20 \)

Now, let's calculate the total number of animals in Safari National Park:
\[
100 \text{ (lions)} + 50 \text{ (snakes)} + 40 \text{ (giraffes)} + 80 \text{ (zebras)} + 45 \text{ (elephants)} + 120 \text{ (monkeys)} + 20 \text{ (crocodiles)} = 455
\]

Next, we'll determine the number of each type of animal in Savanna National Park using the relationships provided:

1. **Lions**: Double as many as Safari National Park, so \( 2 \times 100 = 200 \)
2. **Snakes**: Triple as many as Safari National Park, so \( 3 \times 50 = 150 \)
3. **Giraffes**: 20 more than Safari National Park, so \( 40 + 20 = 60 \)
4. **Zebras**: Half as many as lions, so \( \frac{200}{2} = 100 \)
5. **Elephants**: 20 more than Safari National Park, so \( 45 + 20 = 65 \)
6. **Monkeys**: 10 fewer than zebras, so \( 100 - 10 = 90 \)

He also buys 4 alpacas that cost 25% less each than a llama. He buys 2 zebras that cost twice as much as a goat each. He buys as many ponies as goats, and each pony costs $100 more than a goat. He buys 5 peacocks that cost 50% less each than a pony. How much did he spend?",10950.0,"Let's break down the costs step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of goats
Tim buys 3 goats at $400 each.
\[
\text{Cost of goats} = 3 \times 400 = 1200
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number and cost of llamas
Tim buys twice as many llamas as goats, so he buys \(2 \times 3 = 6\) llamas.
The cost of each llama is 50% more than a goat, so each llama costs \(400 \times 1.5 = 600\) dollars.
\[
\text{Cost of llamas} = 6 \times 600 = 3600
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number and cost of alpacas
Tim buys 4 alpacas, and each alpaca costs 25% less than a llama. So each alpaca costs \(600 \times 0.75 = 450\) dollars.
\[
\text{Cost of alpacas} = 4 \times 450 = 1800
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of zebras
Tim buys 2 zebras, and each zebra costs twice as much as a goat.
\[
\text{Cost of each zebra} = 2 \times 400 = 800
\]
\[
\text{Cost of zebras} = 2 \times 800 = 1600
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the number and cost of ponies
Tim buys as many ponies as goats, so he buys 3 ponies. Each pony costs $100 more than a goat, so each pony costs \(400 + 100 = 500\) dollars.
\[
\text{Cost of ponies} = 3 \times 500 = 1500
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the number and cost of peacocks
Tim buys 5 peacocks, and each peacock costs 50% less than a pony. So each peacock costs \(500 \times 0.5 = 250\) dollars.
\[
\text{Cost of peacocks} = 5 \times 250 = 1250
\]

### Step 7: Sum up all the costs
Now we add up all the individual costs:

A knot is a nautical term for speed equal to 1 nautical mile per hour, and one nautical mile equals 1.15 land miles. If she travels in her sailboat under optimal wind conditions for 4 hours with one sail and then for another 4 hours with two sails, Under the same conditions, the use of three sails brings the ship to the speed of 60 knots, and she sails for 1 hour using three sails. Under the same conditions, the use of four sails brings the ship to the speed of 70 knots, and she sails for 2 hours using four sails. Under the same conditions, sailing with one reefed sail brings her ship to the speed of 15 knots, and she sails for 4 hours with a reefed sail. Under the same conditions, the use of two sails while carrying extra cargo brings her ship to the speed of 40 knots, and she sails for 1 hour using two sails with the extra cargo. what is the total distance, in land miles, that she will travel?",690.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance traveled during each segment of the trip and then sum these distances.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Distance traveled with one sail for 4 hours:**
   - Speed with one sail = 25 knots
   - Time = 4 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 25 knots × 4 hours = 100 nautical miles

2. **Distance traveled with two sails for 4 hours:**
   - Speed with two sails = 50 knots
   - Time = 4 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 50 knots × 4 hours = 200 nautical miles

3. **Distance traveled with three sails for 1 hour:**
   - Speed with three sails = 60 knots
   - Time = 1 hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 knots × 1 hour = 60 nautical miles

4. **Distance traveled with four sails for 2 hours:**
   - Speed with four sails = 70 knots
   - Time = 2 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 70 knots × 2 hours = 140 nautical miles

5. **Distance traveled with one reefed sail for 4 hours:**
   - Speed with one reefed sail = 15 knots
   - Time = 4 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 15 knots × 4 hours = 60 nautical miles

6. **Distance traveled with two sails with extra cargo for 1 hour:**
   - Speed with two sails with extra cargo = 40 knots
   - Time = 1 hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 40 knots × 1 hour = 40 nautical miles

### Summing Up the Distances:

Now, we add up all the distances calculated above:

\[
100 \text{ nautical miles} + 200 \text{ nautical miles} + 60 \text{ nautical miles} + 140 \text{ nautical miles} + 60 \text{ nautical miles} + 40 \text{ nautical miles}

2. **Aaron**: He won't eat any lasagna.
3. **Kai**: He will eat twice as much as Manny, so he will eat \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pieces.
4. **Raphael**: He will eat half the amount Manny does, so he will eat \(0.5 \times 1 = 0.5\) pieces.
5. **Lisa**: She will eat 2 pieces plus any leftover from Raphael. Since Raphael eats 0.5 pieces, she will eat \(2 + (0.5 - 0) = 2.5\) pieces (assuming Raphael finishes his piece completely).
6. **Nora**: She will eat one-third of what Manny eats, so she will eat \(\frac{1}{3} \times 1 = \frac{1}{3}\) pieces.
7. **Ben**: He will eat the same amount as Kai, so he will eat 2 pieces.
8. **Tina**: She will eat 3 pieces.
9. **Omar**: He will eat half as much as Kai, so he will eat \(0.5 \times 2 = 1\) piece.

His company has 6 sectors with different t-shirt colors. Two sectors use white t-shirts and black t-shirts. He paid $20 for white men's t-shirts and $18 for black men's t-shirts. He paid $22 for blue men's t-shirts. He paid $21 for red men's t-shirts. He paid $19 for green men's t-shirts. He paid $17 for gray men's t-shirts. Each sector has 10 men and 10 women, so there are 120 employees in total. How much did he spend total on buying t-shirts?",2040.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of t-shirts for both men and women across all sectors and then sum these costs.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the prices for each type of men's t-shirt:**
   - White men's t-shirts: $20
   - Black men's t-shirts: $18
   - Blue men's t-shirts: $22
   - Red men's t-shirts: $21
   - Green men's t-shirts: $19
   - Gray men's t-shirts: $17

2. **Determine the price for women's t-shirts:**
   - Women's t-shirts are $5 cheaper than men's t-shirts of the same color.
   - Therefore, the prices for women's t-shirts will be:
     - White women's t-shirts: $20 - $5 = $15
     - Black women's t-shirts: $18 - $5 = $13
     - Blue women's t-shirts: $22 - $5 = $17
     - Red women's t-shirts: $21 - $5 = $16
     - Green women's t-shirts: $19 - $5 = $14
     - Gray women's t-shirts: $17 - $5 = $12

3. **Calculate the total cost for one sector:**
   - Each sector has 10 men and 10 women.
   - Total number of employees per sector: \(10 \text{ (men)} + 10 \text{ (women)} = 20 \text{ employees}\).

4. **Calculate the total cost for all sectors:**
   - There are 6 sectors.
   - Total number of employees: \(6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ employees}\).

5. **Calculate the total cost for men's t-shirts:**
   - Cost for white men's t-shirts: \(2 \times 10 \times 20 = 400\)
   - Cost for black men's t-shirts: \(2 \times 10 \times 18 = 360\)
   - Cost for blue men's t-shirts: \(2 \times 10 \times 22 = 440\)
   - Cost for red men's t-shirts: \(2 \times 10 \times 21 = 420\)
   - Cost for green men's t-shirts: \(2 \times 10 \times 19 = 380\)
   - Cost for gray men's t-shirts: \(2 \times 10 \times 17 = 340\)

   Summing these up:
   \[
   400 + 360 + 440 + 420 + 380 + 340 = 2340
   \]

6. **Calculate the total cost for women's t-shirts:**
   - Cost for white women's t-shirts: \(2 \times 10 \times 15 = 300\)
   - Cost for black women's t-shirts: \(2 \times 10 \times 13 = 260\)
   - Cost for blue women's t-shirts: \(2 \times 10 \times 17 = 340\)
   - Cost for red women's t-shirts: \(2 \times 10 \times 16 = 320\)
   - Cost for green women's t-shirts: \(2 \times 10 \times 14 = 280\)
   - Cost for gray women's t-shirts: \(2 \times 10 \times 12 = 240\)

   Summing these up:
   \[
   300 + 260 + 340 + 320 + 280 + 240 = 1740
   \]

He also has 10 crickets. He also has 2 crabs. What is the total number of legs in his entire collection?,270.0,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of creature Monroe has and then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Spiders:**
   - Each spider has 8 legs.
   - Monroe has 8 spiders.
   - Total legs from spiders = \( 8 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs/spider} = 64 \text{ legs} \).

2. **Ants:**
   - Each ant has 6 legs.
   - Monroe has 12 ants.
   - Total legs from ants = \( 12 \text{ ants} \times 6 \text{ legs/ant} = 72 \text{ legs} \).

3. **Beetles:**
   - Each beetle has 6 legs.
   - Monroe has 5 beetles.
   - Total legs from beetles = \( 5 \text{ beetles} \times 6 \text{ legs/beetle} = 30 \text{ legs} \).

4. **Scorpions:**
   - Each scorpion has 8 legs.
   - Monroe has 3 scorpions.
   - Total legs from scorpions = \( 3 \text{ scorpions} \times 8 \text{ legs/scorpion} = 24 \text{ legs} \).

5. **Crickets:**
   - Each cricket has 6 legs.
   - Monroe has 10 crickets.
   - Total legs from crickets = \( 10 \text{ crickets} \times 6 \text{ legs/cricket} = 60 \text{ legs} \).

6. **Crabs:**
   - Each crab has 8 legs.
   - Monroe has 2 crabs.
   - Total legs from crabs = \( 2 \text{ crabs} \times 8 \text{ legs/crab} = 16 \text{ legs} \).

- The number of blue gumballs \( B \) is half the number of red gumballs: 
  \[
  B = \frac{R}{2}

- The number of green gumballs \( G \) is four times the number of blue gumballs:
  \[
  G = 4B = 4 \left(\frac{R}{2}\right) = 2R
  \]

- The number of yellow gumballs \( Y \) is equal to the number of blue gumballs:
  \[
  Y = B = \frac{R}{2}
  \]

- The number of purple gumballs \( P \) is three fewer than the number of red gumballs:
  \[
  P = R - 3
  \]

- The number of orange gumballs \( O \) is twice the number of blue gumballs:
  \[
  O = 2B = 2 \left(\frac{R}{2}\right) = R

- The number of pink gumballs \( K \) is one-fourth the number of green gumballs:
  \[
  K = \frac{G}{4} = \frac{2R}{4} = \frac{R}{2}
  \]

Given that the machine has 16 red gumballs:
\[
R = 16
\]

Now we can calculate the number of each type of gumball using \( R = 16 \):

- Number of blue gumballs \( B \):
  \[
  B = \frac{R}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8

- Number of yellow gumballs \( Y \):
  \[
  Y = B = 8

- Number of orange gumballs \( O \):
  \[
  O = R = 16
  \]

- Number of pink gumballs \( K \):
  \[
  K = \frac{R}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8

Finally, we sum up all the gumballs to find the total number of gumballs in the machine:
\[
R + B + G + Y + P + O + K = 16 + 8 + 32 + 8 + 13 + 16 + 8 = 91
