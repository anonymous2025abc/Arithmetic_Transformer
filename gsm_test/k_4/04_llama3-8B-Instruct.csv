The number of wild dogs is 50 more than the number of hyenas, which is 152. So the number of wild dogs is 152 + 50 = 202.

The number of leopards is half the number of rabbits, which is 114. So the number of leopards is 114 / 2 = 57.

The number of zebras is twice the number of leopards, which is 57. So the number of zebras is 57 * 2 = 114.

The number of giraffes is 3 fewer than the number of zebras, which is 114. So the number of giraffes is 114 - 3 = 111.

The number of buffaloes is half the number of antelopes and rabbits combined, which is 194. So the number of buffaloes is 194 / 2 = 97.

The number of monkeys is two-thirds the number of rabbits and leopards combined, which is 114 + 57 = 171. So the number of monkeys is 171 * 2/3 = 114.

Savanna National park has 10 fewer monkeys than its zebras. Safari National park also has one-fifth as many crocodiles as lions. Savanna National park has twice as many crocodiles as Safari National park. How many animals in total does Savanna National park have?",705.0,"Let's start by calculating the number of animals in Safari National park:

* Lions: 100
* Snakes: 100 / 2 = 50
* Giraffes: 50 - 10 = 40
* Zebras: 40 * 2 = 80
* Elephants: 50 - 5 = 45, then 45 + 20 = 65
* Monkeys: 40 * 3 = 120
* Crocodiles: 100 / 5 = 20

Total animals in Safari National park: 100 + 50 + 40 + 80 + 65 + 120 + 20 = 475

Now, let's calculate the number of animals in Savanna National park:

* Lions: 100 * 2 = 200
* Snakes: 50 * 3 = 150
* Giraffes: 40 + 20 = 60
* Zebras: 200 / 2 = 100
* Elephants: 65 + 20 = 85
* Monkeys: 100 - 10 = 90
* Crocodiles: 20 * 2 = 40

Total animals in Savanna National park: 200 + 150 + 60 + 100 + 85 + 90 + 40 = 725

Under the same conditions, the use of two sails while carrying extra cargo brings her ship to the speed of 40 knots, and she sails for 1 hour using two sails with the extra cargo. what is the total distance, in land miles, that she will travel?",690.0,"First, we need to convert the speeds from knots to nautical miles per hour. Since 1 knot is equal to 1 nautical mile per hour, we can use the given speeds directly.

For the first part of the trip, she sails for 4 hours with one sail at 25 knots. So, she travels a distance of:

25 knots * 4 hours = 100 nautical miles

Since 1 nautical mile is equal to 1.15 land miles, we can convert the distance to land miles:

100 nautical miles * 1.15 land miles/nautical mile = 115 land miles

For the second part of the trip, she sails for 4 hours with two sails at 50 knots. So, she travels a distance of:

50 knots * 4 hours = 200 nautical miles

Converting this to land miles:

200 nautical miles * 1.15 land miles/nautical mile = 230 land miles

For the third part of the trip, she sails for 1 hour with three sails at 60 knots. So, she travels a distance of:

60 knots * 1 hour = 60 nautical miles

Converting this to land miles:

60 nautical miles * 1.15 land miles/nautical mile = 69 land miles

For the fourth part of the trip, she sails for 2 hours with four sails at 70 knots. So, she travels a distance of:

70 knots * 2 hours = 140 nautical miles

Converting this to land miles:

140 nautical miles * 1.15 land miles/nautical mile = 161 land miles

For the fifth part of the trip, she sails for 4 hours with a reefed sail at 15 knots. So, she travels a distance of:

15 knots * 4 hours = 60 nautical miles

Converting this to land miles:

60 nautical miles * 1.15 land miles/nautical mile = 69 land miles

For the sixth part of the trip, she sails for 1 hour with two sails and extra cargo at 40 knots. So, she travels a distance of:

40 knots * 1 hour = 40 nautical miles

Converting this to land miles:

40 nautical miles * 1.15 land miles/nautical mile = 46 land miles
