How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle, Alice, Bob, David and Zoe have together if Zoe has 20 sheep?",16380.0,"To determine the total number of sheep that Toulouse, Charleston, Seattle, Alice, Bob, David, and Zoe have together, we start by finding out how many sheep each person has based on the given relationships and the number of sheep Zoe has.

1. **Determine the number of sheep David has:**
   Zoe has 20 sheep. Since David has 2 times as many sheep as Zoe, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{David's sheep} = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

2. **Determine the number of sheep Bob has:**
   Bob has 3 times as many sheep as David, so we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Bob's sheep} = 3 \times 40 = 120
   \]

3. **Determine the number of sheep Alice has:**
   Alice has 5 times as many sheep as Bob, so we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Alice's sheep} = 5 \times 120 = 600

   \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times 1200 = 4800
   \]

6. **Determine the number of sheep Toulouse has:**
   Toulouse has 2 times as many sheep as Charleston, so we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times 4800 = 9600
   \]

7. **Calculate the total number of sheep:**
   We add up the number of sheep each person has:
   \[
   \text{Total sheep} = \text{Toulouse's sheep} + \text{Charleston's sheep} + \text{Seattle's sheep} + \text{Alice's sheep} + \text{Bob's sheep} + \text{David's sheep} + \text{Zoe's sheep}

   - Each bathroom wall takes up 150 square feet.
   - There are 8 bathroom walls.
   - Total square footage for the bathroom walls: \( 150 \times 8 = 1200 \) square feet.

6. **Garage:**
   - Each garage wall takes up 480 square feet.
   - There are 5 garage walls.
   - Total square footage for the garage walls: \( 480 \times 5 = 2400 \) square feet.

1. **Chopping peppers:**
   Bill needs to chop 4 peppers, and it takes him 3 minutes to chop each pepper.
   \[
   4 \text{ peppers} \times 3 \text{ minutes/pepper} = 12 \text{ minutes}

His sister, Marquita, is tilling the soil for two gardens that each measure 8 feet by 4 feet. Luis is working on 4 gardens that each measure 10 feet by 6 feet. Tasha is working on 1 garden that measures 12 feet by 9 feet. Nia is working on 2 gardens that each measure 7 feet by 7 feet. Omar is working on 3 gardens that each measure 5 feet by 14 feet. How many square feet combined are in all their gardens?",960.0,"To determine the total square footage of all the gardens, we need to calculate the area of each garden and then sum the areas for each person. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
\]

Let's start with Mancino:
- Mancino has 3 gardens, each measuring 16 feet by 5 feet.
- The area of one garden is \(16 \times 5 = 80\) square feet.
- Therefore, the total area for Mancino's gardens is \(3 \times 80 = 240\) square feet.

Next, let's calculate for Marquita:
- Marquita has 2 gardens, each measuring 8 feet by 4 feet.
- The area of one garden is \(8 \times 4 = 32\) square feet.
- Therefore, the total area for Marquita's gardens is \(2 \times 32 = 64\) square feet.

Now, let's calculate for Luis:
- Luis has 4 gardens, each measuring 10 feet by 6 feet.
- The area of one garden is \(10 \times 6 = 60\) square feet.
- Therefore, the total area for Luis's gardens is \(4 \times 60 = 240\) square feet.

Next, let's calculate for Tasha:
- Tasha has 1 garden measuring 12 feet by 9 feet.
- The area of one garden is \(12 \times 9 = 108\) square feet.
- Therefore, the total area for Tasha's garden is \(1 \times 108 = 108\) square feet.

Now, let's calculate for Nia:
- Nia has 2 gardens, each measuring 7 feet by 7 feet.
- The area of one garden is \(7 \times 7 = 49\) square feet.
- Therefore, the total area for Nia's gardens is \(2 \times 49 = 98\) square feet.

Finally, let's calculate for Omar:
- Omar has 3 gardens, each measuring 5 feet by 14 feet.
- The area of one garden is \(5 \times 14 = 70\) square feet.
- Therefore, the total area for Omar's gardens is \(3 \times 70 = 210\) square feet.

Now, we sum the areas of all the gardens:
\[
240 + 64 + 240 + 108 + 98 + 210
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
240 + 64 = 304
\]
\[
304 + 240 = 544
\]
\[
544 + 108 = 652
\]
\[
652 + 98 = 750

\[
750 + 210 = 960

She also stirs in 3 scoops of sherbet that weigh 10 oz each. How many 10 oz servings of punch does Carrie have?",26.0,"To determine the total volume of punch Carrie makes, we need to add up the volumes of all the ingredients she uses. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Mountain Dew**: Carrie adds 6 cans of Mountain Dew, and each can is 12 ounces.
   \[
   6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ oz}
   \]

2. **Ice**: Carrie adds 28 ounces of ice.
   \[
   28 \text{ oz}
   \]

3. **Fruit Juice**: Carrie adds a 40-ounce bottle of fruit juice.
   \[
   40 \text{ oz}
   \]

4. **Ginger Ale**: Carrie adds 5 cans of ginger ale, and each can is 8 ounces.
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ oz}
   \]

5. **Orange Soda**: Carrie adds 2 bottles of orange soda, and each bottle is 15 ounces.
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ oz}
   \]

6. **Cranberry Juice**: Carrie adds a 20-ounce bottle of cranberry juice.
   \[
   20 \text{ oz}
   \]

7. **Sherbet**: Carrie adds 3 scoops of sherbet, and each scoop is 10 ounces.
   \[
   3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ oz}
   \]

Now, we add up all these volumes:
\[
72 + 28 + 40 + 40 + 30 + 20 + 30 = 260 \text{ oz}
\]

To find out how many 10-ounce servings of punch Carrie has, we divide the total volume by 10:
\[
260 \div 10 = 26
\]

Therefore, the number of 10-ounce servings of punch Carrie has is \(\boxed{26}\).",26,26.0,True,

Wanda brings half as many treats as Jane and three times as many pieces of bread as treats. Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane and twice as many pieces of bread as treats. Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda and half as many pieces of bread as treats. Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda and four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats. Priya brings twice as many treats as Carlos and one-fourth as many pieces of bread as treats. If Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread, what is the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo?",446.0,"To determine the total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone brought to the zoo, we need to calculate the number of treats and pieces of bread each person brought based on the given relationships and then sum them up.

First, let's find out how many treats Wanda brought. We know that Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread and three times as many pieces of bread as treats. Let \( T_W \) be the number of treats Wanda brought. Then:
\[ 3T_W = 90 \]
\[ T_W = \frac{90}{3} = 30 \]

Now, we can find out how many treats and pieces of bread each person brought:

1. **Jane**: Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats. Let \( T_J \) be the number of treats Jane brought. Then:
\[ T_J = T_W = 30 \]
\[ \text{Pieces of bread Jane brought} = 0.75 \times T_J = 0.75 \times 30 = 22.5 \]
Since the number of pieces of bread must be a whole number, we assume it was a typo and should be 22.5.

2. **Wanda**: Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread and 30 treats.

3. **Carlos**: Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane and twice as many pieces of bread as treats. Then:
\[ T_C = \frac{T_J}{3} = \frac{30}{3} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Pieces of bread Carlos brought} = 2 \times T_C = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]

4. **Mia**: Mia brings 10 fewer treats than Wanda and half as many pieces of bread as treats. Then:
\[ T_M = T_W - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20 \]
\[ \text{Pieces of bread Mia brought} = \frac{T_M}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

5. **Omar**: Omar brings one and a half times as many treats as Wanda and four-fifths as many pieces of bread as treats. Then:
\[ T_O = 1.5 \times T_W = 1.5 \times 30 = 45 \]
\[ \text{Pieces of bread Omar brought} = \frac{4}{5} \times T_O = \frac{4}{5} \times 45 = 36 \]

6. **Priya**: Priya brings twice as many treats as Carlos and one-fourth as many pieces of bread as treats. Then:
\[ T_P = 2 \times T_C = 2 \times 10 = 20 \]
\[ \text{Pieces of bread Priya brought} = \frac{T_P}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Now, we sum up the total number of treats and pieces of bread brought by everyone:
\[ \text{Total treats} = T_J + T_W + T_C + T_M + T_O + T_P = 30 + 30 + 10 + 20 + 45 + 20 = 155 \]
\[ \text{Total pieces of bread} = 22.5 + 90 + 20 + 10 + 36 + 5 = 183.5 \]

Since the number of pieces of bread must be a whole number, we assume it was a typo and should be 22.5.

\[ \text{Total number of pieces of bread and treats} = 155 + 183.5 = 183.5]

The total number of pieces of bread and treats that everyone mentioned brought to the zoo is \boxed{183}.

Han visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude did. Jude visited half as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa did. Omar visited 3 more rehabilitation centers than Jude did. Priya visited 1 less than three times as many rehabilitation centers as Han did. Chen visited twice as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa did. Nia visited 4 fewer than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jane did. If Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers, how many rehabilitation centers did they all visit in total, assuming they are all different?",80.0,"To determine the total number of rehabilitation centers visited by Jane, Han, Jude, Omar, Priya, Chen, Nia, and Lisa, we will follow the given relationships step by step.

1. **Lisa's Visits:**
   \[
   L = 6
   \]

2. **Jude's Visits:**
   Jude visited half as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa.
   \[
   J = \frac{L}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
   \]

3. **Han's Visits:**
   Han visited 2 less than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jude.
   \[
   H = 2J - 2 = 2 \times 3 - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4
   \]

4. **Omar's Visits:**
   Omar visited 3 more rehabilitation centers than Jude.
   \[
   O = J + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6
   \]

5. **Priya's Visits:**
   Priya visited 1 less than three times as many rehabilitation centers as Han.
   \[
   P = 3H - 1 = 3 \times 4 - 1 = 12 - 1 = 11
   \]

6. **Chen's Visits:**
   Chen visited twice as many rehabilitation centers as Lisa.
   \[
   C = 2L = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

7. **Jane's Visits:**
   Jane visited 6 more than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Han.
   \[
   Jn = 2H + 6 = 2 \times 4 + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14
   \]

8. **Nia's Visits:**
   Nia visited 4 fewer than twice as many rehabilitation centers as Jane.
   \[
   N = 2Jn - 4 = 2 \times 14 - 4 = 28 - 4 = 24
   \]

Now, we sum up the visits of all individuals:
\[
L + J + H + O + P + C + Jn + N = 6 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 11 + 12 + 14 + 24
\]

Calculating the sum step by step:
\[
6 + 3 = 9
\]
\[
9 + 4 = 13
\]
\[
13 + 6 = 19
\]
\[
19 + 11 = 30
\]
\[
30 + 12 = 42
\]
\[
42 + 14 = 56
\]
\[
56 + 24 = 80

Thus, the total number of rehabilitation centers visited by all of them is:

He then spends half as long trimming her nails as he spent brushing her. Before the walk, he drives 9 miles to the trailhead at 30 miles per hour. At the trailhead, he spends 6 minutes filling her water bowl and giving her a treat. Then he takes her for a walk along a 3-mile trail. If Marcus walks at 6 miles per hour, how much time does he spend with his dog total?",96.0,"To determine the total time Marcus spends with his dog, we need to break down each activity and sum up the time spent on each. Let's go through each step:

1. **Bathing the dog:**
   Marcus spends 20 minutes giving his dog a bath.

2. **Blow-drying the dog:**
   Marcus spends half as long blow-drying her as he does bathing her.
   \[
   \text{Blow-drying time} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Brushing the dog:**
   Marcus spends 8 minutes brushing his dog.

4. **Trimming the nails:**
   Marcus spends half as long trimming her nails as he does brushing her.
   \[
   \text{Trimming time} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Driving to the trailhead:**
   Marcus drives 9 miles to the trailhead at 30 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Driving time} = \frac{9 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.3 \text{ hours} = 0.3 \times 60 = 18 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Filling the water bowl and giving a treat:**
   Marcus spends 6 minutes filling her water bowl and giving her a treat.

7. **Walking the dog:**
   Marcus takes her for a 3-mile walk along a trail at 6 miles per hour.
   \[
   \text{Walking time} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles per hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours} = 0.5 \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the times:
\[
\text{Total time} = 20 + 10 + 8 + 4 + 18 + 6 + 30
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
20 + 10 = 30
\]
\[
30 + 8 = 38
\]
\[
38 + 4 = 42
\]
\[
42 + 18 = 60
\]
\[
60 + 6 = 66
\]
\[
66 + 30 = 96
\]

Therefore, the total time Marcus spends with his dog is:

There are 4 boxes of crayons that hold 6 green crayons. There are 2 boxes of crayons that hold 9 purple crayons. There are 3 boxes of crayons that hold 10 yellow crayons. There are 5 boxes of crayons that hold 4 brown crayons. How many crayons are there in total?,186.0,"To find the total number of crayons, we need to calculate the number of crayons in each color category and then sum them up.

1. **Orange Crayons:**
   - There are 6 boxes.
   - Each box contains 8 orange crayons.
   \[
   6 \times 8 = 48
   \]
   So, there are 48 orange crayons.

2. **Blue Crayons:**
   - There are 7 boxes.
   - Each box contains 5 blue crayons.
   \[
   7 \times 5 = 35
   \]
   So, there are 35 blue crayons.

3. **Red Crayons:**
   - There is 1 box.
   - Each box contains 11 red crayons.
   \[
   1 \times 11 = 11
   \]
   So, there are 11 red crayons.

4. **Green Crayons:**
   - There are 4 boxes.
   - Each box contains 6 green crayons.
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24
   \]
   So, there are 24 green crayons.

5. **Purple Crayons:**
   - There are 2 boxes.
   - Each box contains 9 purple crayons.
   \[
   2 \times 9 = 18
   \]
   So, there are 18 purple crayons.

6. **Yellow Crayons:**
   - There are 3 boxes.
   - Each box contains 10 yellow crayons.
   \[
   3 \times 10 = 30
   \]
   So, there are 30 yellow crayons.

7. **Brown Crayons:**
   - There are 5 boxes.
   - Each box contains 4 brown crayons.
   \[
   5 \times 4 = 20
   \]
   So, there are 20 brown crayons.

Now, we sum up all the crayons:
\[
48 + 35 + 11 + 24 + 18 + 30 + 20
\]

Let's add them step by step:
\[
48 + 35 = 83
\]
\[
83 + 11 = 94
\]
\[
94 + 24 = 118
\]
\[
118 + 18 = 136
\]
\[
136 + 30 = 166

\[
166 + 20 = 186

They also have a younger brother named Liam who is 1 year younger than the youngest of the three oldest brothers. They also have a younger brother named Noah who is 1 year younger than Liam. They also have a younger brother named Owen who is 1 year younger than Noah. They also have a younger brother named Ethan who is 1 year younger than Owen. How old is the youngest brother?,27.0,"To determine the age of the youngest brother, we start by defining the ages of the three oldest brothers. Let the age of the youngest brother be \( x \). Since the ages are consecutive integers, the age of the middle brother is \( x+1 \) and the age of the oldest brother is \( x+2 \).

The sum of their ages is given as 96. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 96
\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
\[
3x + 3 = 96
\]

Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[
3x = 93
\]

Then, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 3:
\[
x = 31
\]

So, the youngest brother is 31 years old. The ages of the three oldest brothers are 31, 32, and 33. The younger brothers are Liam, Noah, Owen, and Ethan. Since each younger brother is 1 year younger than the previous one, we can determine their ages as follows:
- Liam is \( 31 - 1 = 30 \) years old.
- Noah is \( 30 - 1 = 29 \) years old.
- Owen is \( 29 - 1 = 28 \) years old.

First, let's find the number of each type of animal in Safari National Park:
- Lions: 100
- Snakes: \( \frac{100}{2} = 50 \)
- Giraffes: \( 50 - 10 = 40 \)
- Zebras: \( 2 \times 40 = 80 \)
- Elephants: \( 50 - 5 = 45 \)
- Monkeys: \( 3 \times 40 = 120 \)
- Crocodiles: \( \frac{100}{5} = 20 \)

Now, let's find the number of each type of animal in Savanna National Park:
- Lions: \( 2 \times 100 = 200 \)
- Snakes: \( 3 \times 50 = 150 \)
- Giraffes: \( 40 + 20 = 60 \)

He buys 5 peacocks that cost 50% less each than a pony. How much did he spend?",10950.0,"To determine the total amount Tim spent on animals for his zoo, we need to calculate the cost of each type of animal and then sum these costs. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of goats:**
   Tim buys 3 goats, and each goat costs $400.
   \[
   3 \times 400 = 1200
   \]
   So, the total cost for goats is $1200.

2. **Cost of llamas:**
   Tim gets twice as many llamas as goats. Since he bought 3 goats, he buys \(2 \times 3 = 6\) llamas. Each llama costs 50% more than a goat, so each llama costs \(400 + 0.5 \times 400 = 400 + 200 = 600\).
   \[
   6 \times 600 = 3600
   \]
   So, the total cost for llamas is $3600.

3. **Cost of alpacas:**
   Tim buys 4 alpacas, and each alpaca costs 25% less than a llama. Since each llama costs $600, each alpaca costs \(600 - 0.25 \times 600 = 600 - 150 = 450\).
   \[
   4 \times 450 = 1800
   \]
   So, the total cost for alpacas is $1800.

4. **Cost of zebras:**
   Tim buys 2 zebras, and each zebra costs twice as much as a goat. Since each goat costs $400, each zebra costs \(2 \times 400 = 800\).
   \[
   2 \times 800 = 1600
   \]
   So, the total cost for zebras is $1600.

5. **Cost of ponies:**
   Tim buys as many ponies as goats, so he buys 3 ponies. Each pony costs $100 more than a goat, so each pony costs \(400 + 100 = 500\).
   \[
   3 \times 500 = 1500
   \]
   So, the total cost for ponies is $1500.

6. **Cost of peacocks:**
   Tim buys 5 peacocks, and each peacock costs 50% less than a pony. Since each pony costs $500, each peacock costs \(500 - 0.5 \times 500 = 500 - 250 = 250\).
   \[
   5 \times 250 = 1250
   \]
   So, the total cost for peacocks is $1250.

Now, we sum the costs of all the animals:
\[
1200 + 3600 + 1800 + 1600 + 1500 + 1250 = 11950

\[ \text{Distance}_1 = 25 \text{ knots} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 100 \text{ nautical miles} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance traveled with two sails for 4 hours:

Next, let's calculate the cost of each of Mell's two friends who ordered the same as Mell but also bought a bowl of ice cream:
- Each friend ordered 2 cups of coffee, 1 piece of cake, and 1 bowl of ice cream.
- The cost of 2 cups of coffee is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.
- The cost of 1 piece of cake is \(7\) dollars.
- The cost of 1 bowl of ice cream is \(3\) dollars.
- Therefore, the total cost of each friend's order is \(8 + 7 + 3 = 18\) dollars.

1. **Manny**: Manny will eat 1 piece.
2. **Aaron**: Aaron will eat 0 pieces.
3. **Kai**: Kai will eat twice as much as Manny, so Kai will eat \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pieces.
4. **Raphael**: Raphael will eat half the amount Manny does, so Raphael will eat \(\frac{1}{2} \times 1 = 0.5\) pieces.
5. **Lisa**: Lisa will eat 2 pieces plus any Raphael has left of his piece. Since Raphael eats 0.5 pieces, he has \(0.5\) pieces left. Therefore, Lisa will eat \(2 + 0.5 = 2.5\) pieces.
6. **Nora**: Nora will eat one-third of what Manny eats, so Nora will eat \(\frac{1}{3} \times 1 = \frac{1}{3}\) pieces. Lisa will eat whatever Nora leaves of her piece. Since Nora eats \(\frac{1}{3}\) pieces, Lisa will eat \(2.5 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{7.5}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{6.5}{3} = \frac{13}{6}\) pieces.

Her friends are Jessica, Tori, Lily, Patrice, Ava, Monique, Ben, and Charlotte. If each jelly bracelet costs $2, what is the total she will spend in dollars?",88.0,"To determine the total amount Robin will spend on jelly bracelets, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of letters in each friend's first name.
2. Sum the total number of letters for all friends.
3. Multiply the total number of letters by the cost of each jelly bracelet.

Let's start with the first step:

- Jessica has 7 letters.
- Tori has 4 letters.
- Lily has 4 letters.
- Patrice has 7 letters.
- Ava has 4 letters.
- Monique has 7 letters.
- Ben has 3 letters.
- Charlotte has 7 letters.

Next, we sum the total number of letters:

\[
7 + 4 + 4 + 7 + 4 + 7 + 3 + 7
\]

We can group the numbers to make the addition easier:

\[
(7 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7) + (4 + 4 + 4) + 3
\]

Calculate each group:

\[
7 \times 5 = 35
\]
\[
4 \times 3 = 12
\]
\[
3 = 3
\]

Now, add these results together:

\[
35 + 12 + 3 = 50
\]

So, the total number of letters is 50. Since each jelly bracelet costs $2, we multiply the total number of letters by the cost per bracelet:

\[
50 \times 2 = 100
\]

Therefore, the total amount Robin will spend is \(\boxed{100}\) dollars.",100,100.0,False,

If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",101.0,"Let's start by defining the number of red gumballs as \( R \). According to the problem, the machine has 16 red gumballs, so \( R = 16 \).

Next, we know the machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs. Therefore, the number of blue gumballs \( B \) is:
\[ B = \frac{R}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \]

For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. Therefore, the number of green gumballs \( G \) is:
\[ G = 4B = 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs. Therefore, the number of yellow gumballs \( Y \) is:
\[ Y = B = 8 \]

The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs. Therefore, the number of purple gumballs \( P \) is:
\[ P = R - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

The machine has twice as many orange gumballs as blue gumballs. Therefore, the number of orange gumballs \( O \) is:
\[ O = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

The machine has one-fourth as many pink gumballs as green gumballs. Therefore, the number of pink gumballs \( K \) is:
\[ K = \frac{G}{4} = \frac{32}{4} = 8 \]

Now, we sum up all the gumballs in the machine:
\[ R + B + G + Y + P + O + K = 16 + 8 + 32 + 8 + 13 + 16 + 8 = 111 \]

Thus, the total number of gumballs in the machine is:
