There were also four times as many brown candies as blue candies. If Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, how many candies remained?",820.0," Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.

First, let's find out how many candies of each color there were:

1. Red candies: 40
2. Yellow candies: 3 * 40 - 20 = 100
3. Blue candies: 100 / 2 = 50
4. Green candies: 40 / 2 = 20
5. Purple candies: 5 * 100 - 10 = 490
6. Orange candies: 100 / 5 = 20
7. Brown candies: 4 * 50 = 200

Now, let's add up all the candies to find out how many candies there were in total:

Total candies = 40 (red) + 100 (yellow) + 50 (blue) + 20 (green) + 490 (purple) + 20 (orange) + 200 (brown) = 820 candies

If Carlos ate all of the yellow candies, we need to subtract the number of yellow candies from the total number of candies:

The living room walls take up 600 square feet.

The bedroom walls take up 400 square feet each and there are 3 of them, so the total square footage of the bedroom walls is 400 * 3 = 1200 square feet.

The kitchen walls take up 500 square feet each and there are 6 of them, so the total square footage of the kitchen walls is 500 * 6 = 3000 square feet.

The dining room walls take up 240 square feet each and there are 5 of them, so the total square footage of the dining room walls is 240 * 5 = 1200 square feet.

The bathroom walls take up 150 square feet each and there are 8 of them, so the total square footage of the bathroom walls is 150 * 8 = 1200 square feet.

The garage walls take up 480 square feet each and there are 5 of them, so the total square footage of the garage walls is 480 * 5 = 2400 square feet.

Adding up all the square footage, we get 600 + 1200 + 3000 + 1200 + 1200 + 2400 = 10000 square feet.

Since one gallon of paint covers 600 square feet, Henrietta will need 10000 / 600 = 16.67 gallons of paint.

Since she can't buy a fraction of a gallon, she will need to buy 17 gallons of paint.

From the problem, we know that:

R = 30 (red marbles collected by Jenny)
B = 25 (blue marbles collected by Jenny)

Now, let's find out the number of marbles collected by the other friends:

Mary collected twice as many red marbles as Jenny, so Mary collected 2R = 2*30 = 60 red marbles.

Anie collected 20 more red marbles than Mary, so Anie collected 60 + 20 = 80 red marbles.

Anie collected twice the number of blue marbles Jenny collected, so Anie collected 2B = 2*25 = 50 blue marbles.

Tom collected three times as many red marbles as Mary, so Tom collected 3*60 = 180 red marbles.

Tom collected 5 fewer blue marbles than Jenny, so Tom collected 25 - 5 = 20 blue marbles.

Sara collected 10 fewer red marbles than Anie, so Sara collected 80 - 10 = 70 red marbles.

Sara collected five times as many blue marbles as Mary, so Sara collected 5*60 = 300 blue marbles.

Leo collected three times as many red marbles as Jenny, so Leo collected 3*30 = 90 red marbles.

Leo collected three times as many blue marbles as Jenny, so Leo collected 3*25 = 75 blue marbles.

Maya collected five times as many red marbles as Tom, so Maya collected 5*180 = 900 red marbles.

Maya collected 3 fewer blue marbles than Sara, so Maya collected 300 - 3 = 297 blue marbles.

Now, let's add up all the blue marbles collected by the friends:

B (Jenny) + B (Anie) + B (Tom) + B (Sara) + B (Leo) + B (Maya) = 25 + 50 + 20 + 300 + 75 + 297 = 777

How long will he spend preparing for and cooking the 5 omelets?",92.0," First, let's calculate the time Bill spends on each ingredient:

- Peppers: He needs to chop 4 peppers, and it takes him 3 minutes to chop a pepper. So, he spends 4 * 3 = 12 minutes on peppers.
- Onions: He needs to chop 2 onions, and it takes him 4 minutes to chop an onion. So, he spends 2 * 4 = 8 minutes on onions.
- Cheese: He needs to grate cheese for 5 omelets, and it takes him 1 minute to grate enough cheese for one omelet. So, he spends 5 * 1 = 5 minutes on cheese.
- Tomatoes: He needs to chop 3 tomatoes, and it takes him 4 minutes to chop a tomato. So, he spends 3 * 4 = 12 minutes on tomatoes.
- Mushrooms: He adds mushrooms to each of the 5 omelets, and it takes him 2 minutes to slice enough mushrooms for one omelet. So, he spends 5 * 2 = 10 minutes on mushrooms.
- Ham: He adds ham to each of the 5 omelets, and it takes him 3 minutes to dice enough ham for one omelet. So, he spends 5 * 3 = 15 minutes on ham.
- Spinach: He adds spinach to each of the 5 omelets, and it takes him 1 minute to rinse a handful of spinach for one omelet. So, he spends 5 * 1 = 5 minutes on spinach.

Now, let's add up the time he spends on each ingredient: 12 (peppers) + 8 (onions) + 5 (cheese) + 12 (tomatoes) + 10 (mushrooms) + 15 (ham) + 5 (spinach) = 67 minutes.

Finally, let's add the time he spends assembling and cooking the omelets. It takes him 5 minutes to assemble and cook one omelet, and he is making 5 omelets. So, he spends 5 * 5 = 25 minutes on cooking.

Adding the time he spends on preparing for cooking and the time he spends cooking, we get 67 (preparing) + 25 (cooking) = 92 minutes.

So, Bill will spend 92 minutes preparing for and cooking the 5 omelets.

1. Total produce of apples: Twice the total produce of mangoes, so 2 * 400 kg = 800 kg.
2. Total produce of oranges: 200 kg more than that of mangoes, so 400 kg + 200 kg = 600 kg.
3. Total produce of bananas: 100 kg fewer than apples, so 800 kg - 100 kg = 700 kg.
4. Total produce of peaches: Half the total produce of oranges, so 600 kg / 2 = 300 kg.
5. Total produce of guavas: One-fourth as many as mangoes, so 400 kg / 4 = 100 kg.
6. Total produce of lemons: 50 kg more than the total produce of peaches, so 300 kg + 50 kg = 350 kg.

Now, let's add up all the produce to get the total produce:

800 kg (apples) + 400 kg (mangoes) + 600 kg (oranges) + 700 kg (bananas) + 300 kg (peaches) + 100 kg (guavas) + 350 kg (lemons) = 3250 kg.

Since he sold the fruits at $50 per kg, the total amount of money he got in that season is:

3250 kg * $50/kg = $162,500.

Under the same conditions, sailing with one reefed sail brings her ship to the speed of 15 knots, and she sails for 4 hours with a reefed sail. Under the same conditions, the use of two sails while carrying extra cargo brings her ship to the speed of 40 knots, and she sails for 1 hour using two sails with the extra cargo. what is the total distance, in land miles, that she will travel?",690.0," First, we need to convert the speed of the sailboat from knots to land miles per hour. 

1 knot = 1.15 land miles per hour.

So, the speed of the sailboat when using one sail is 25 knots * 1.15 = 28.75 land miles per hour.
The speed of the sailboat when using two sails is 50 knots * 1.15 = 57.5 land miles per hour.
The speed of the sailboat when using three sails is 60 knots * 1.15 = 69 land miles per hour.
The speed of the sailboat when using four sails is 70 knots * 1.15 = 79.5 land miles per hour.
The speed of the sailboat when using one reefed sail is 15 knots * 1.15 = 17.25 land miles per hour.
The speed of the sailboat when using two sails with extra cargo is 40 knots * 1.15 = 46 land miles per hour.

Next, we calculate the distance traveled for each sailing condition.

Distance = Speed * Time

For the first 4 hours with one sail, the distance traveled is 28.75 land miles per hour * 4 hours = 115 land miles.
For the next 4 hours with two sails, the distance traveled is 57.5 land miles per hour * 4 hours = 230 land miles.
For the 1 hour with three sails, the distance traveled is 69 land miles per hour * 1 hour = 69 land miles.
For the 2 hours with four sails, the distance traveled is 79.5 land miles per hour * 2 hours = 159 land miles.
For the 4 hours with one reefed sail, the distance traveled is 17.25 land miles per hour * 4 hours = 69 land miles.
For the 1 hour with two sails with extra cargo, the distance traveled is 46 land miles per hour * 1 hour = 46 land miles.

Finally, we add up all the distances to get the total distance traveled.

Total distance = 115 land miles + 230 land miles + 69 land miles + 159 land miles + 69 land miles + 46 land miles = 688 land miles.

9. Omar will eat half as much as Kai.

Now, let's calculate how much lasagna each person will eat:

1. Manny eats 1 piece.
2. Aaron eats 0 pieces.
3. Kai eats twice as much as Manny, so he eats 2 * 1 = 2 pieces.
4. Raphael eats half the amount Manny does, so he eats 0.5 * 1 = 0.5 pieces. Since we can't have half a piece, we'll round up to 1 piece.
5. Lisa eats two pieces, plus any leftovers from Raphael's piece. Since Raphael eats 1 piece, Lisa eats 2 + 1 = 3 pieces.
6. Nora eats one-third of what Manny eats, so she eats 1/3 * 1 = 0.33 pieces. Since we can't have a fraction of a piece, we'll round up to 1 piece.
7. Ben eats the same amount of lasagna as Kai, so he eats 2 pieces.
8. Tina eats 3 pieces.
9. Omar eats half as much as Kai, so he eats 0.5 * 2 = 1 piece.

Adding up all the pieces:

1 (Manny) + 0 (Aaron) + 2 (Kai) + 1 (Raphael) + 3 (Lisa) + 1 (Nora) + 2 (Ben) + 3 (Tina) + 1 (Omar) = 16 pieces

2. Tony has 3 times as many fish as Billy, so Tony has 3 * 10 = 30 fish.
3. Sarah has 5 more fish than Tony, so Sarah has 30 + 5 = 35 fish.
4. Bobby has twice as many fish as Sarah, so Bobby has 2 * 35 = 70 fish.
5. Nina has 2 fewer fish than Billy, so Nina has 10 - 2 = 8 fish.
6. Priya has 4 times as many fish as Nina, so Priya has 4 * 8 = 32 fish.
7. Omar has half as many fish as Bobby, so Omar has 70 / 2 = 35 fish.
8. Chen has 10 more fish than Sarah, so Chen has 35 + 10 = 45 fish.

Now, let's add up all the fish:

10 (Billy's fish) + 30 (Tony's fish) + 35 (Sarah's fish) + 70 (Bobby's fish) + 8 (Nina's fish) + 32 (Priya's fish) + 35 (Omar's fish) + 45 (Chen's fish) = 255 fish

So, all the people mentioned have 255 fish put together.

The answer is $\boxed{255}$.",255,255.0,False,

Riley has 10 fewer stuffed animals than Tenly. Avery has half as many stuffed animals as Kenley. Jordan has 3 times as many stuffed animals as McKenna. Casey has 7 more stuffed animals than Avery. How many stuffed animals do all the people mentioned have in all?,415.0," McKenna has 34 stuffed animals.
Kenley has twice as many as McKenna, so Kenley has 2 * 34 = 68 stuffed animals.
Tenly has 5 more than Kenley, so Tenly has 68 + 5 = 73 stuffed animals.
Riley has 10 fewer stuffed animals than Tenly, so Riley has 73 - 10 = 63 stuffed animals.
Avery has half as many stuffed animals as Kenley, so Avery has 68 / 2 = 34 stuffed animals.
Jordan has 3 times as many stuffed animals as McKenna, so Jordan has 3 * 34 = 102 stuffed animals.
Casey has 7 more stuffed animals than Avery, so Casey has 34 + 7 = 41 stuffed animals.

Adding up all the stuffed animals, we have 34 (McKenna) + 68 (Kenley) + 73 (Tenly) + 63 (Riley) + 34 (Avery) + 102 (Jordan) + 41 (Casey) = 445 stuffed animals.

So the answer is $\boxed{445}$.",445,445.0,False,

Her friends are Jessica, Tori, Lily, Patrice, Ava, Monique, Ben, and Charlotte. If each jelly bracelet costs $2, what is the total she will spend in dollars?",88.0," First, we need to count the number of letters in each friend's name.

Jessica has 7 letters.
Tori has 4 letters.
Lily has 4 letters.
Patrice has 7 letters.
Ava has 3 letters.
Monique has 7 letters.
Ben has 3 letters.
Charlotte has 8 letters.

Now, we add up all the letters to get the total number of bracelets Robin needs to buy.

7 (for Jessica) + 4 (for Tori) + 4 (for Lily) + 7 (for Patrice) + 3 (for Ava) + 7 (for Monique) + 3 (for Ben) + 8 (for Charlotte) = 45 bracelets.

Since each bracelet costs $2, we multiply the total number of bracelets by the cost of each bracelet to find the total cost.

45 bracelets * $2/bracelet = $90.

So, Robin will spend a total of $90 on jelly bracelets.

The answer is $\boxed{90}$.",90,90.0,False,

He also has 10 crickets. He also has 2 crabs. What is the total number of legs in his entire collection?,270.0," To solve this problem, we need to count the number of legs for each type of insect and then add them together.

First, let's count the number of legs for each type of insect:

- Ants: Ants have 6 legs. Since Monroe has 12 ants, the total number of ant legs is 12 * 6 = 72 legs.
- Spiders: Spiders have 8 legs. Since Monroe has 8 spiders, the total number of spider legs is 8 * 8 = 64 legs.
- Beetles: Beetles have 6 legs. Since Monroe has 5 beetles, the total number of beetle legs is 5 * 6 = 30 legs.
- Scorpions: Scorpions have 8 legs. Since Monroe has 3 scorpions, the total number of scorpion legs is 3 * 8 = 24 legs.
- Crickets: Crickets have 6 legs. Since Monroe has 10 crickets, the total number of cricket legs is 10 * 6 = 60 legs.
- Crabs: Crabs have 8 legs. Since Monroe has 2 crabs, the total number of crab legs is 2 * 8 = 16 legs.

Now, let's add up the total number of legs:

72 (ant legs) + 64 (spider legs) + 30 (beetle legs) + 24 (scorpion legs) + 60 (cricket legs) + 16 (crab legs) = 266 legs

So, the total number of legs in Monroe's entire collection is 266.

12,deepseek-7b,deepseek-ai/deepseek-math-7b-instruct,4,50,49,"A gumball machine has red, green, and blue gumballs. The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs. For each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs. The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs. The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs. The machine has twice as many orange gumballs as blue gumballs. The machine has one-fourth as many pink gumballs as green gumballs. If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",101.0," Let's denote the number of red gumballs as R, the number of blue gumballs as B, the number of green gumballs as G, the number of yellow gumballs as Y, the number of purple gumballs as P, and the number of orange gumballs as O.

From the problem, we know that:

1. R = 16 (given)
2. B = R/2 (the machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs)
3. G = 4B (for each blue gumball, the machine has 4 times as many green gumballs)
4. Y = B (the machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs)
5. P = R - 3 (the machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs)
6. O = 2B (the machine has twice as many orange gumballs as blue gumballs)
7. Pink = G/4 (the machine has one-fourth as many pink gumballs as green gumballs)

Now, let's substitute the values and calculate the number of each color gumballs:

1. B = 16/2 = 8
2. G = 4*8 = 32
3. Y = 8
4. P = 16 - 3 = 13
5. O = 2*8 = 16
6. Pink = 32/4 = 8

Finally, let's add up all the gumballs to get the total number:

Total = R + B + G + Y + P + O + Pink
Total = 16 + 8 + 32 + 8 + 13 + 16 + 8 = 105

So, the machine has 105 gumballs in total.

The answer is $\boxed{105}$.",105,105.0,False,
