1. **David:** David has 2 times as many sheep as Zoe, who has 20 sheep. So David has 2 * 20 = 40 sheep.

2. **Bob:** Bob has 3 times as many sheep as David, who has 40 sheep. So Bob has 3 * 40 = 120 sheep.

3. **Alice:** Alice has 5 times as many sheep as Bob, who has 120 sheep. So Alice has 5 * 120 = 600 sheep.

4. **Seattle:** Seattle has 2 times as many sheep as Alice, who has 600 sheep. So Seattle has 2 * 600 = 1200 sheep.

5. **Charleston:** Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, who has 1200 sheep. So Charleston has 4 * 1200 = 4800 sheep.

6. **Toulouse:** Toulouse has 2 times as many sheep as Charleston, who has 4800 sheep. So Toulouse has 2 * 4800 = 9600 sheep.

* Jane brings 75% as many pieces of bread as treats, so she brings 0.75 * Wanda's treats = 0.75 * 90 = 67.5 pieces of bread.

**2. Calculate Wanda's treats:**

* Wanda brings 90 pieces of bread.

**3. Calculate Carlos' contributions:**

* Carlos brings one-third as many treats as Jane: 1/3 * Jane's treats = 1/3 * (0.75 * 90) = 22.5 treats.
* Carlos brings twice as many pieces of bread as treats: 2 * Carlos' treats = 2 * 22.5 = 45 pieces of bread.

If Lisa visited 6 rehabilitation centers, how many rehabilitation centers did they all visit in total, assuming they are all different?",80.0,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Jude's visits:** Jude visited half as many centers as Lisa, who visited 6, so Jude visited 6 / 2 = 3 rehabilitation centers.

2. **Han's visits:** Han visited 2 less than twice the number Jude visited, so Han visited (2 * 3) - 2 = 4 rehabilitation centers.

3. **Jane's visits:** Jane visited 6 more than twice the number Han visited, so Jane visited (2 * 4) + 6 = 14 rehabilitation centers.

If his farm produced 400 kg of mangoes and he sold the fruits at $50 per kg, calculate the total amount of money he got in that season.",162500.0,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Apples:** Mr. Sergio produced twice the amount of apples as mangoes, so he produced 2 * 400 kg = 800 kg of apples.

2. **Oranges:** He produced 200 kg more oranges than mangoes, so he produced 400 kg + 200 kg = 600 kg of oranges.

3. **Bananas:** He produced 100 kg fewer bananas than apples, so he produced 800 kg - 100 kg = 700 kg of bananas.

4. **Peaches:** He harvested half the amount of peaches as oranges, so he produced 600 kg / 2 = 300 kg of peaches.

5. **Guavas:** He harvested one-fourth the amount of guavas as mangoes, so he produced 400 kg / 4 = 100 kg of guavas.

6. **Lemons:** He produced 50 kg more lemons than peaches, so he produced 300 kg + 50 kg = 350 kg of lemons.

7. **Total Produce:**  To find the total produce, add up all the fruits: 800 kg + 400 kg + 600 kg + 700 kg + 300 kg + 100 kg + 350 kg = 3250 kg

8. **Total Earnings:**  He sold all the fruits at $50 per kg, so his total earnings were 3250 kg * $50/kg = $162,500

If the machine has 16 red gumballs how many gumballs are in the machine?",101.0,"Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Blue gumballs:** The machine has half as many blue gumballs as red gumballs, so there are 16 / 2 = 8 blue gumballs.

2. **Green gumballs:** For each blue gumball, there are 4 times as many green gumballs, so there are 8 * 4 = 32 green gumballs.

3. **Yellow gumballs:** The machine has as many yellow gumballs as blue gumballs, so there are 8 yellow gumballs.

4. **Purple gumballs:** The machine has 3 fewer purple gumballs than red gumballs, so there are 16 - 3 = 13 purple gumballs.

5. **Orange gumballs:** The machine has twice as many orange gumballs as blue gumballs, so there are 8 * 2 = 16 orange gumballs.

6. **Pink gumballs:** The machine has one-fourth as many pink gumballs as green gumballs, so there are 32 / 4 = 8 pink gumballs.

7. **Total gumballs:**  Add up all the types of gumballs: 16 + 8 + 32 + 8 + 13 + 16 + 8 = **91**
